Deparia petersenii subsp. congrua (Brack.),,180-910mm-long,"Deparia petersenii subsp. congrua is a terrestrial fern that grows in damp soils along stream banks, near hot streams, on alluvial terraces, lakesides, swamp margins, and bush margins, and on tracksides and road banks. It grows in kauri, podocarp (especially kahikatea), and broadleaved forest, and under mānuka and kānuka, as well as under introduced Salix and Pinus species. 8Recognition: In New Zealand Deparia petersenii subsp. congrua is recognised by its creeping rhizomes, and fronds, that bear both scales and hairs, the latter being more abundant distally and adaxially. The primary pinnae are divided almost to the costae into secondary pinnae, which are sometimes themselves divided more than halfway to the midrib. Neither the secondary or tertiary segments are ever completely divided to the costae. The sori are elongated along the veins and sometimes arranged back-to-back. Subsp. congrua is distinguished from subsp. petersenii by its thinner and less brittle laminae, lacking blue-green iridescence on the adaxial surface, and its primary pinnae, which are more highly divided to within c. 1 mm of the costa. Cytology: n = 82 (Brownlie 1961). Notes: This species has been widely misidentified in earlier New Zealand literature as Diplazium japonicum (Thunb.) Beddome or Athyrium japonicum (Thunb.) Copel. based on Asplenium japonicum Thunb. Kato (1984) recognised three subspecies within D. petersenii . Subsp. congrua was distinguished from subsp. petersenii by its lamina and pinnae, which narrowed gradually to an acuminate apex rather than narrowing abruptly; and from subsp. deflexa by its thicker rhizome (up to 5 mm diameter cf. up to 2.5 mm diameter), more widely spaced stipes, and oblique rather than patent pinna segments. Subsp. congrua is present in Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific, whereas subsp. petersenii occurs from the Himalayas to Japan and south to Papua New Guinea, and subsp. deflexa in peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, and Java. However, following work on Deparia (Kuo et al. 2016), Kuo noted that D. petersenii is not a monophyletic group and there is a lot of polyploidy (Kuo, pers. comm. 2016), suggesting that these taxa may need to be revisited, including the possibility that subsp. deflexa is just a small form of subsp. congrua . In New Zealand, Deparia petersenii subsp. congrua is remarkable in that it was not recorded until found on the Kermadec Islands by Cheeseman (1888) and then at the Ōkura River near Kerikeri by Miss Clarke (Cheeseman 1890). In the first edition of his Manual of the New Zealand Flora , Cheeseman (1906) cited specimens from Kaitāia, the Bay of Islands, and the Wairoa River – all areas that were well covered by many earlier botanists in New Zealand but who apparently failed to find it. Allan (1961) and Crookes (1963) also recorded it only from the Kermadec Islands and the North Island. If Kirk’s Asplenium umbrosum var. tenuifolium is treated as an extreme form of Deparia petersenii subsp. congrua (see below), then his record (Kirk 1891) would be the first for the South Island, more or less contemporaneous with its discovery at the Bay of Islands and on the Kermadec Islands. In the North Island there appears to have been a steady southward movement of this taxon having been recorded from Te Whāiti in 1920 (AK 114934), Rotorua in 1927 (CHR 292805), Taumarunui in 1967 (CHR 165882), Whanganui River in 1967 (WELT P025053), Kapiti Island in 1962 (WELT P023617), Paraparaumu in 1967 (WELT P010589), and Mananui near Hokitika in 1940 (CHR 23790). The biostatus of subsp. congrua in New Zealand is unresolved. It is unclear whether it is a relatively recent natural arrival or was introduced by human intervention. It was first detected at about the same time in three widely different locations, and appears to have spread extensively since that time to the point where it is now well integrated with native vegetation in many areas. Kato (1984) recognised both D. petersenii and D. tenuifolia in New Zealand. He stated that D. tenuifolia differed in “its more deeply cut leaves with pinnatifid and well-spaced pinnules. Larger plants of D. petersenii with lobed pinna-segments approach D. tenuifolia , but in D. tenuifolia even smaller leaves are tripinnatifid with well-spaced pinnules”. In our opinion there is a gradation from 1- pinnate-pinnatifid to 1-pinnate-bipinnatifid forms, with the latter occurring most frequently in shaded habitats rather than in the open. This also reflects the views of de Lange (1988, 1989), who observed plants in the wild and grew highly divided forms in cultivation, noting that they reverted to 1-pinnate- pinnatifid forms within 8 months. In agreement with his suggestion, D. tenuifolia is here reduced to synonymy with D. petersenii . The name Asplenium umbrosum var. leumfolia was published by Dobbie (1931, p. 314) with a one-line description and without any accompanying illustration. Although described as a variety of Asplenium umbrosum (= Diplazium australe ), the description states “root creeping”, which presumably indicates a creeping rhizome. If so, that would exclude Diplazium australe and would relate better to Deparia petersenii . However, no specimens of this taxon are known, and without either a specimen or an illustration it is impossible to know what it represents. 9Fig. 12 : Deparia petersenii subsp. congrua .

Diplazium australe (R.Br.),,340-1400mm-long; 80-525mm-long; 40-270mm-wide; 2m-long,"Diplazium australe is a terrestrial fern that grows in damp soils and silt along stream banks, on alluvial terraces and swamp margins, in damp paddocks and ditches, and on forest margins and in clearings. It grows under podocarp (especially kahikatea) and broadleaved forest, under mature mānuka and kānuka, and under Pinus and willows. It is often found in association with Deparia petersenii . Recognition: Diplazium australe is recognised by its erect rhizomes that sometimes form a short trunk, and fronds that are more or less 3-pinnate and are either glabrous or bear a few scales on the stipes and rachises. The sori are elongated along the veins, either singly or with at least a few arranged back-to-back. The free margins of the indusia are entire or only lightly toothed.

Asplenium appendiculatum (Labill.),,80-640mm-long; 40-480mm-long; 15-200mm-wide,"A terrestrial fern that occurs under podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, in mānuka, kānuka, and low scrub, in tussock grassland, under introduced pine plantations and under other exotics in urban environments. On Antipodes Island it grows under tussocks and occasionally as a low epiphyte on Coprosma antipoda . It grows on the forest floor, on fallen trunks, cliffs, banks, streamsides, boulders, in rock crevices, under rock overhangs, and occasionally as a low epiphyte. It is found on greywacke, sandstone, schist, limestone, marble, and ultramafic rock types. Recognition: Asplenium appendiculatum subsp. appendiculatum occurs from about Raglan and Mt Hikurangi southwards but is largely absent from the west coast of the South Island. It is distinguished from the more widespread A. flaccidum subsp. flaccidum by its usually terrestrial habitat, its upright and more divided fronds, its octoploid rather than tetraploid chromosome number, and its larger and more prominently ridged spores. It is morphologically similar to A. richardii , and the two taxa often grow in close proximity. However, A. appendiculatum subsp. appendiculatum has more coriaceous fronds with pinnae that lie in one plane rather than spreading in three dimensions, ultimate segments that are slightly wider (1–1.5 mm, cf. 0.5–1 mm wide), and indusia that are generally longer (2–8 mm, cf. 1.5–4 mm long). Cytology: n = 144 (Brownsey 1977a, as A. terrestre subsp. terrestre ), n = c. 140 (Beuzenberg in Godley 1989, as A. terrestre ).

Asplenium appendiculatum subsp. maritimum (Brownsey),,40-670mm-long,"A terrestrial fern that occurs only on coastal cliffs within the influence of salt spray, either on exposed rocks where plants are rather stunted, or in coastal scrub, kānuka scrub, low coastal forest or pine plantations, where they grow much bigger. It favours weathered greywacke rock, but can also be found on sandstone or breccia around Auckland, or on basalt near Christchurch. Recognition: Asplenium appendiculatum subsp. maritimum is distinguished from subsp. appendiculatum by its coastal habitat, thicker and fleshier fronds, secondary pinnae that decrease only slightly along the primary pinnae, and sometimes by its broader laminae. It occupies a similar coastal habitat to A. flaccidum subsp. haurakiense , although the two do not overlap in their distributions; subsp. haurakiense usually has an enlarged basal acroscopic secondary segment, which is markedly larger than the adjacent segment, whereas in A. appendiculatum subsp. maritimum the secondary pinnae decrease gradually in size from the proximal to distal end of each primary pinna. The spores of the two taxa are also markedly different (see Brownsey 1977a; Large & Braggins 1991). Cytology: n = 144 (Brownsey 1977a, as A. terrestre subsp. maritimum ). Hybridisation: There is evidence that A. appendiculatum subsp. maritimum hybridises with A. flaccidum subsp. flaccidum (Brownsey 1977b) and A. gracillimum (newly recorded here). 14Notes: This taxon was first described by Dobbie (1931) as A. flaccidum var. littoralis . However, that name has no precedence when the taxon is recognised at the rank of subspecies as A. appendiculatum subsp. maritimum . The names “litoralis” and “literoralis” in the protologue are orthographic errors to be corrected to “littoralis”. Fig. 13 : Asplenium appendiculatum subsp. maritimum .

"Asplenium bulbiferum G.Forst., Fl. Ins. Austr. 80 (1786)",,290-1600mm-long,"A terrestrial fern that occurs under kauri, podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, and under tall mānuka and kānuka forest. It grows in wetter and more shaded habitats on the forest floor, in gullies, amongst rocks or tree roots, on banks, streamsides, river terraces, lake margins and shaded road cuttings on both acidic and base rich soils. It is capable of spreading vegetatively by means of its bulbils. Recognition: Asplenium bulbiferum is usually readily recognised by the presence of bulbils on the upper surface of the lamina. However, similar bulbils also occur in A. gracillimum , albeit less frequently. Characters for distinguishing the two species are discussed in detail under A. gracillimum . Bulbils sometimes also occur in hybrids that involve A. bulbiferum as one parent, but such plants can always be recognised by their aborted spores. 16Cytology: n = 72 (Brownlie 1954; Brownsey 1977a). Hybridisation: There is evidence that A. bulbiferum hybridises with A. flaccidum subsp. flaccidum , A. hookerianum , A. lamprophyllum , A. oblongifolium , A. obtusatum (Brownsey 1977b), A. cimmeriorum (Brownsey & de Lange 1997), A. appendiculatum subsp. appendiculatum and A. gracillimum (newly recorded here). Notes: Analysis of low-copy nuclear DNA sequences strongly suggests that A. bulbiferum is one tetraploid parent of two allopolyploid species, A. cimmeriorum and A. gracillimum (Shepherd et al. 2008; Perrie et al. 2010).

"Asplenium chathamense Brownsey, New Zealand J. Bot. 23: 135 (1985)",,100-980mm-long,"Grows most frequently on exposed coastal rocks and cliffs, but also on the ground, on stream banks, peat banks, logs, rock faces and in rock crevices under coastal forest, or rarely as a low epiphyte. It is found on basalt, schist, and limestone. Recognition: Asplenium chathamense is confined to the Chatham Islands and occurs most frequently on coastal rocks and in coastal scrub. It is morphologically similar to both A. flaccidum and A. appendiculatum . It has firmer, more divided fronds that are held upright, and a terrestrial or rupestral habitat, whereas A. flaccidum subsp. flaccidum has pendent, limp fronds and usually an epiphytic habitat. It is more similar to A. flaccidum subsp. haurakiense , which occupies a similar habitat on coastal rocks in northern New Zealand. The two can be distinguished by the secondary pinnae, which decrease in size along the length of the primary pinnae in A. chathamense , whereas in A. flaccidum subsp. haurakiense the basal acroscopic secondary pinna is markedly longer than all the others. Also, the stipe scales in A. flaccidum subsp. haurakiense are shorter and have much thicker cell walls than those of A. chathamense . In general frond appearance, A. chathamense is most similar to A. appendiculatum , especially to subsp. maritimum , which occupies a similar coastal habitat. However, A. chathamense is tetraploid whereas A. appendiculatum is octoploid, and the spores of the latter have sharper, more numerous ridges (see Brownsey 1977a; Large & Braggins 1991). Asplenium appendiculatum has not been recorded from the Chatham Islands (Brownsey 1977a; de Lange et al. 2011). Cytology: n = 72 (Brownsey 1985). Hybridisation: There is evidence that A. chathamense hybridises with A. lyallii , A. obtusatum (Brownsey 1985; de Lange et al. 2011) and A. flaccidum subsp. flaccidum (newly recorded here).

"Asplenium cimmeriorum Brownsey & de Lange, New Zealand J. Bot. 35: 283 (1997)",,45-370mm-long,"Asplenium cimmeriorum is largely confined to dark, calcareous sites in high-rainfall, lowland to montane areas (Brownsey & de Lange 1997). It grows most frequently at limestone cave entrances, under overhangs, on cave walls and ceilings or associated rockfalls, or sometimes in deeper caves near the limit of daylight penetration. In the South Island, plants also extend out into surrounding forest, growing on rotting logs, amongst tree roots, or on limestone boulders and rock faces. Recognition: Asplenium cimmeriorum is morphologically similar to A. bulbiferum , A. gracillimum , and A. hookerianum , but differs from all three in having a short-creeping rhizome. It has generally smaller fronds than either A. bulbiferum or A. gracillimum , and lacks the bulbils of those species. It has a slightly narrower frond than A. hookerianum , and is octoploid rather than tetraploid, with larger spores (44–52 × 33–39 μm cf. 31–37 × 23–27 μm). Its habitat is also distinctive. Cytology: n = c. 144 (Brownsey & de Lange 1997). Hybridisation: There is evidence that A. cimmeriorum hybridises with A. bulbiferum (Brownsey & de Lange 1997). Notes: DNA analyses strongly suggest that A. cimmeriorum is an allopolyploid species derived from A. bulbiferum and A. hookerianum , and that the populations from the North and South Island have independent polyploid origins (Shepherd et al. 2008; Perrie et al. 2010).

"Asplenium decurrens Willd., Sp. Pl. 5 (1)",,790mm-long,"Asplenium decurrens grows on exposed coastal rocks and cliffs, in crevices and amongst boulders, and in low coastal scrub. It is found on a variety of rock substrates, including andesite, basalt, breccia, greywacke, lava, limestone, calcareous mudstone, sandstone, scoria, pumice, and guano. Recognition: Asplenium decurrens is morphologically very similar to A. obtusatum and A. oblongifolium . It occupies a similar coastal habitat to A. obtusatum and is only distinguished by its slightly shorter and narrower laminae (23–370 mm long, 15–160 mm wide, cf. 27–540 mm long, 23–290 mm wide), narrower stipe scales, larger spores, and octoploid chromosome number. However, the two species are geographically separated, A. decurrens occurring north from the north Taranaki coast, and A. obtusatum only south from Kapiti Island. Asplenium decurrens is distinguished from A. oblongifolium by its thick, fleshy fronds, rather round-ended pinnae, and narrowly ovate rather than hair-like stipe scales. Both species can occupy coastal habitats, but A. decurrens does not extend into inland areas. Plants of A. decurrens produce their largest fronds on the Kermadec and Three Kings Islands. They gradually diminish in size southwards, with only rather stunted plants occurring around Auckland and the western Waikato. This is in contrast to A. obtusatum , which produces its largest fronds in the subantarctic and gradually decreases in size northwards. Cytology: n = 144 (Brownsey 1977a – as A. obtusatum subsp. northlandicum ). Hybridisation: There is evidence that A. decurrens (as A. obtusatum subsp. northlandicum ) hybridises with A. oblongifolium , A. shuttleworthianum (Brownsey 1977b), and A. flaccidum subsp. haurakiense (newly recorded here). Notes: The new combination Asplenium northlandicum (Brownsey) Ogle was published in Vol. 25, No. 4, of the NZ Journal of Botany . Although dated 1987, it was not published until April 1988, as indicated in Vol. 26, No. 1. Asplenium decurrens was previously treated as A. obtusatum subsp. northlandicum , an octoploid subspecies (Brownsey 1977a) suggested to be an autopolyploid derivative of the tetraploid A. obtusatum (Brownsey 1977b). However, Shepherd et al. (2008) used nuclear DNA sequence data from New Zealand material to show that this origin is unlikely. Rather, they suggested that 23A. decurrens (as A. northlandicum ) is an allopolyploid, with either A. obtusatum or A. oblongifolium as the chloroplast parent and an unknown tetraploid as the other parent. That conclusion supported the recognition of the octoploid as a distinct species, rather than as a subspecies of the tetraploid A. obtusatum . Ogle (1988) had previously raised the subspecies to species level, as A. northlandicum , but at this rank there are actually two earlier available names when Australian and New Zealand populations are treated as the same taxon – A. decurrens Willd. and A. sarmentosum Willd. (Brownsey & Perrie 2016). The two species were described by Willdenow (1810) from Tasmania and distinguished from A. obtusatum G.Forst. and A. obliquum G.Forst., which Willdenow believed to be confined to New Zealand. Earlier, Labillardière (1807) had accepted A. obtusatum and A. obliquum in Australia as well as New Zealand. Brownsey (1977a) reduced A. obliquum to synonymy with A. obtusatum , accepting the latter name as the earliest available for the tetraploid species. It is present in New Zealand but not in Australia. However, the octoploid cytotype is now believed to occur in both New Zealand and Australia, and when treated at species level, either of Willdenow’s names could be applied to it. Asplenium decurrens was preferred by Brownsey & Perrie (2016) because Willdenow indicated that he had seen a specimen of it, and the holotype collected by Labillardière is extant in the Willdenow herbarium (B-W 19885-01 0). In contrast, Willdenow gave no indication of having seen a specimen of A. sarmentosum , none are now extant in the Willdenow herbarium, and the holotype of A. sarmentosum must therefore be the illustration in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen (Labillardière 1806–1807) cited by Willdenow (1810).

"Asplenium flabellifolium Cav., Descr. Pl. 1, 257 (1801)",,45-550mm-long,"Asplenium flabellifolium is a terrestrial fern that spreads by means of its prostrate habit and the rooting tips on its fronds. It occurs under light podocarp, broadleaved, beech, and pōhutukawa forest, under open mānuka, kānuka and low scrub, below Pinus , Salix and Cupressus , under gorse, and often amongst tussocks and introduced grasses. It grows on cliffs, banks, streamsides, rocks, boulders, ledges, crevices, scoria, lava, coastal cliffs, old sand dunes, thermally heated ground, and sometimes around lakes and swamps. Its favoured habitat is dry rock, and it is often associated with Cheilanthes species and Asplenium subglandulosum . 25Recognition: Asplenium flabellifolium is a very distinctive fern recognised by its prostrate habit, pinnate fronds with flabellate pinnae, and rachises that often extend well beyond the distal pinnae and root at their tips. The ability of the fronds to loop over and give rise to new plants vegetatively at their tips is the basis of the vernacular name walking fern. The form of the flabellate pinnae has given rise to the vernacular name butterfly fern. It is superficially similar to Asplenium trichomanes but the latter species can be recognised by its dark brown polished stipes and rachises, which do not root at the tip. Rarely, one or more of the pinnae on a frond may be greatly extended and divided, and themselves produce rooting tips. Such an aberrant specimen was the basis of Colenso’s A. flabellifolium var. ramosum (WELT P005143, P005144). Cytology: 2n = c. 210–211, 277–280 (Brownsey 1977a). The species is now known to be apomictic in both Australia and New Zealand (Lovis 1973; Brownsey 1977a; Tindale & Roy 2002), although an apparently sexual tetraploid population has also been reported from New South Wales (Tindale & Roy 2002). Brownlie (1958) reported n = c. 270 in New Zealand material, but almost certainly erroneously interpreted univalents as bivalents. Hybridisation: Asplenium flabellifolium is unusual among New Zealand species of the genus in that it has not been recorded hybridising with any other species, despite growing in close proximity to many different taxa (Perrie & Brownsey 2005a). Its isolated phylogenetic position in Clade IX of Ohlsen et al. (2014b), in contrast to most New Zealand species, which occur in Clade V, may account for this. Fig. 46 : Asplenium flabellifolium .

South Island: Western Nelson, Sounds-Nelson, Marlborough, Westland, Canterbury, Otago, Southland, Fiordland. Kermadec Islands, Three Kings Islands, Chatham Islands, Solander Island, Stewart Island, Auckland Islands. Altitudinal range: 0–1525 m. Asplenium flaccidum occurs on the Kermadec Islands and the Three Kings Islands, and is widely distributed throughout coastal, lowland and montane areas of the North Island. It grows from sea level to 1100 m in the Kaimanawa Ranges. In the South Island it occurs mostly frequently in lowland to subalpine areas west of the main divide, growing from near sea level to over 1500 m on Mt Arthur, with only scattered populations on the east coast and in inland Canterbury. It extends to Stewart Island, the Chatham Islands and Auckland Islands. Also Australia (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania). Biostatus: Indigenous (Non-endemic). Habitat: Asplenium flaccidum usually grows as an epiphyte in kauri, podocarp, beech, and broadleaved forest, and under mānuka, kānuka and low scrub, as well as on aerial roots, rotten trunks and stumps. It sometimes grows on rocks, mossy banks, stream banks, thermally heated soil, on the ground under Cupressus macrocarpa and Pinus , and on coastal rocks within the immediate vicinity of salt spray, or in coastal scrub and coastal pōhutukawa or karaka forest. Recognition: Asplenium flaccidum is most easily confused with A. appendiculatum but can be distinguished by its tetraploid chromosome number, less divided frond, and the less prominently ridged spore pattern (see Brownsey 1977a; Large & Braggins 1991). Asplenium flaccidum has two distinct forms, which were recognised as separate subspecies by Brownsey (1977a). The differences between them are described below under A. flaccidum subsp. flaccidum . Cytology: n = 72 (Brownlie 1954; Brownsey 1977a). Hybridisation: There is evidence that A. flaccidum hybridises with A. appendiculatum subsp. appendiculatum , A. appendiculatum subsp. maritimum , A. bulbiferum , A. hookerianum , A. oblongifolium , A. obtusatum , A. scleroprium (Brownsey 1977b), A. gracillimum , A. lyallii (de Lange et al. 2011), A. lepidotum (Perrie & Brownsey 2016), A. chathamense , A. decurrens and A. shuttleworthianum (newly recorded here). Notes: Analysis of low-copy nuclear DNA sequences suggests that an Asplenium flaccidum -like lineage is a tetraploid parent of the three allopolyploid species A. appendiculatum , A. scleroprium , and A. shuttleworthianum (Shepherd et al. 2008). The genetic evidence suggests that A. flaccidum subsp. haurakiense is the more likely parent for A. scleroprium , but this is contradicted by the present-day distributions of the two taxa, which do not overlap.",1-7mm-long,40-310mm-long; 3-20mm-long,200mm; 5-37mm-wide,,,,43-51μm-long; 36-41μm-wide,,5-230mm-long,Aspleniaceae,"['indigenous', 'non-endemic']"
"Asplenium flaccidum G.Forst., Fl. Ins. Austr. 80 (1786)",,75-1560mm-long,"Asplenium flaccidum subsp. flaccidum usually grows as an epiphyte in kauri, podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest, and in mānuka, kānuka and low scrub. It has been recorded growing on Cyathea cunninghamii , C. dealbata , C. medullaris , C. smithii , Dicksonia squarrosa , Beilschmiedia tawa , Carex secta , Carpodetus serratus , Cordyline australis , Coriaria arborea , Corynocarpus laevigatus , Dacrydium cupressinum , Fuchsia excorticata , Griselinia littoralis , Hedycarya arborea , Knightia excelsa , Kunzea ericoides , Leptospermum scoparium , Melicytus ramiflorus , Metrosideros spp., Nestegis montana , Olearia colensoi , Pinus sp., Podocarpus totara , Prumnopitys ferruginea , Rhopalostylis sapida , Salix sp., Streblus banksii , Vitex lucens , Weinmannia racemosa , species of Nothofagaceae , and from clumps of Astelia , as well as on aerial roots, rotten trunks and stumps. It sometimes also grows terrestrially on cliffs, rocks and scoria, in crevices, on mossy banks, stream banks, limestone and marble, thermally heated soil, under Cupressus macrocarpa and Pinus , and rarely on sand dunes under marram grass. Recognition: Asplenium flaccidum subsp. flaccidum is typically an epiphytic forest plant growing on tree trunks or hanging from Astelia clumps. It has limp, pendulous, leathery fronds which are usually 1 ‑pinnate-pinnatifid, up to 1.5 m in length, and with the primary pinnae divided almost to the midrib into narrow segments, which bear submarginal, elongated sori. The secondary segments on each primary pinna are usually more or less equal in length, decreasing slightly in size both distally and proximally. However, some populations, especially in the western part of the South Island, have laminae in which the basal acroscopic segment is much longer than the adjacent ones. Sometimes plants of A. flaccidum subsp. flaccidum grow on the ground, especially in rocky scrub and under introduced pine plantations. Such plants have much shorter fronds, but they are still rather limp and pendulous. Asplenium flaccidum subsp. flaccidum is sometimes confused with A. appendiculatum but can be distinguished by its usually epiphytic and pendulous habit, whereas A. appendiculatum grows 29terrestrially, producing upright fronds that are also more divided than in A. flaccidum . The latter is also tetraploid rather than octoploid, with smaller and less prominently ridged spores. Subsp. flaccidum can usually be distinguished from subsp. haurakiense by its habitat and growth form. Subsp. haurakiense almost always grows on the ground or on rocks, occasionally as a low epiphyte on Metrosideros excelsa , in close proximity to the sea. It is confined to the east coast of Northland and islands of the Hauraki Gulf, extending south to the Bay of Plenty. Fronds grow upright, are firmer than in subsp. flaccidum , frequently (but not invariably) have an enlarged basal acroscopic segment on each primary pinna (similar to that sometimes seen in subsp. flaccidum ), and have larger spores (40–49 × 26–33 μm, cf. 35–46 × 21–30 μm, excluding populations from the Kermadec Islands). They also have a slightly different perispore pattern, with less pronounced wings (see Brownsey 1977a; Large & Braggins 1991). The stipe scales are ovate, lack filiform apices, and have thicker cell walls in contrast to the narrower, more drawn out stipe scales of subsp. flaccidum . On the east coast of Northland and on the Hauraki Gulf islands there are relatively few places where the two taxa grow abundantly in close proximity to each other. However, in areas where the two subspecies do occur together (e.g. Poor Knights Islands, Little Barrier Island), it is sometimes difficult to distinguish individual plants, and there is significant overlap in spore size. Nevertheless, most plants can be assigned to one or other of the taxa; plants with spores less than 40 μm long are likely to be subsp. flaccidum , and those with spores wider than 26 μm are usually subsp. haurakiense . The situation on the Kermadec Islands, particularly on Raoul Island, is rather different. On this larger island there is more extensive forest and a long rocky coastline providing abundant habitat for both taxa. A few collections at either end of the morphological spectrum can be assigned to one or other taxon, but the majority of plants appear to be intermediate in morphology, or have a form not seen elsewhere in New Zealand, and are not strongly correlated with habitat. Thus epiphytic forms often have extended basal acroscopic segments, and terrestrial forms sometimes almost completely lack them. Spore size in Kermadec material also varies hugely, with an even greater range than recorded for the two taxa elsewhere in New Zealand (30–49 × 21–30 μm long, cf. 35–49 × 21–33 μm), but size is not correlated with habitat as it is the northern North Island. As noted by Sykes & West (1996), it appears that on the Kermadec Islands the two forms are less clearly distinguished and most plants can only be identified as Asplenium flaccidum sensu lato . No plants with aborted spores have been detected amongst over 75 individual collections examined from throughout its range, including many that are of intermediate morphology. This, together with the wide range of morphology observed on the Kermadec Islands, uncorrelated with habitat, suggests that the two forms are best treated as susbspecies rather than species. It would be possible to test this hypothesis by an in-depth analysis of genetic variation in areas where the two forms regularly occur together (e.g. Kermadec Islands, Poor Knights Islands, Little Barrier Island). Cytology: n = 72 (Brownlie 1954; Brownsey 1977a). Hybridisation: There is evidence that A. flaccidum subsp. flaccidum hybridises with A. appendiculatum subsp. appendiculatum , A. appendiculatum subsp. maritimum , A. bulbiferum , A. hookerianum , A. oblongifolium , A. obtusatum , A. scleroprium (Brownsey 1977b), A. gracillimum , A. lyallii (de Lange et al. 2011), A. lepidotum (Perrie & Brownsey 2016) and A. chathamense (newly recorded here).

"Asplenium flaccidum subsp. haurakiense Brownsey, New Zealand J. Bot. 15: 70 (1977)",,45-680mm-long,"Asplenium flaccidum subsp. haurakiense is a terrestrial fern that grows most frequently on coastal rocks within the immediate vicinity of salt spray, amongst flax, or in coastal scrub and coastal pōhutukawa and karaka forest, or under mānuka and kānuka. Occasionally it is found growing epiphytically on Metrosideros excelsa or M. kermadecensis . It is sometimes found growing in pied shag or petrel colonies, where it can be much larger. Recognition: Differences between subsp. haurakiense and subsp. flaccidum are discussed under A. flaccidum subsp. flaccidum . Asplenium flaccidum subsp. haurakiense can be difficult to separate morphologically from A. appendiculatum , although their distributions barely overlap. Asplenium flaccidum subsp. haurakiense usually has an enlarged basal acroscopic secondary segment which is markedly larger than the adjacent segment, whereas in A. appendiculatum the secondary pinnae decrease gradually in size from the proximal to distal end of each primary pinna. Cytology: n = 72 (Brownsey 1977a).

"Asplenium gracillimum Colenso, Trans. & Proc. New Zealand Inst. 22: 453 (1890)",,105-1080mm-long; 2-7mm-wide; 1mm,"A terrestrial fern that occurs under kauri, podocarp, broadleaved, and beech forest, and under tall kānuka forest. It grows on drier well-drained soils on the forest floor, often on steep slopes, on dry ridges, in gullies, amongst rocks or tree roots, on banks, on logs, by streamsides, on river terraces, in shaded road cuttings, and under rock overhangs. Sometimes it is found in reverting pasture or grazed bush, on stabilised dunes under scrub, or under Pinus radiata . It occurs on a variety of rock types, including greywacke, sandstone, schist, limestone, and marble. Recognition: Asplenium gracillimum is a very variable species; at one extreme there are fronds with broad secondary pinnae that are divided into tertiary segments 2–7 mm wide, and at the other there are fronds that have the secondary pinnae completely divided into narrow ultimate segments 1 mm or less in width. The latter forms were referred to A. bulbiferum var. tripinnatum Hook.f. by many earlier authors, but, as noted by Brownsey (1977a), the type of Hooker’s variety is something different. The specimen is immature and its identity remains uncertain; it is included here in the synonymy for A. gracillimum but could possibly be a hybrid with A. appendiculatum . The two forms of A. gracillimum frequently grow together; the highly divided fronds are, on average, slightly smaller than the broader forms, but their overall size range falls within that for the broad forms. Genetically, several subgroups can be recognised within A. gracillimum (Perrie et al. 2010), but the highly divided forms occur in several of these and collectively they do not comprise a separate lineage. Hence the two forms are not recognised here taxonomically. Asplenium gracillimum is often confused with both A. bulbiferum and A. hookerianum , species that are now known to be its tetraploid parents (Shepherd et al. 2008). Asplenium bulbiferum is generally a larger plant than A. gracillimum and tends to grow in wetter areas. However, the two species frequently occur together and are known to hybridise (Brownsey 1977b). Asplenium bulbiferum usually has more pronounced wings on the rachis and primary costae than A. gracillimum , and only a few of the proximal secondary pinnae on each primary pinna have distinct stalks; in A. gracillimum the secondary pinnae are usually stalked along at least half of the primary pinna. The scales of the two species are markedly different: those in A. bulbiferum are ovate and lack filiform apices, whereas in 35A. gracillimum they are narrower and almost always drawn out into filiform apices. In New Zealand Asplenium bulbiferum is usually bulbiferous with at least a few bulbils on the lamina, whereas A. gracillimum often lacks bulbils or is only sparingly bulbiferous. Asplenium gracillimum also has larger spores than A. bulbiferum (41–48 × 28–32 cf. 34–37 × 23–26 μm), and the two species can be reliably distinguished on this basis. Asplenium gracillimum generally has much larger fronds than A. hookerianum , but small plants of A. gracillimum are sometimes difficult to discriminate. Usually the secondary pinnae of A. hookerianum are more regularly stalked than in very small fronds of A. gracillimum . The basal pair of pinnae are angled acroscopically, whereas those in A. gracillimum arise at right angles to the rachis, or are angled basiscopically. Spore size will also distinguish the two species; A. gracillimum has larger spores than A. hookerianum (41–48 × 28–32 cf. 31–37 × 23–27 μm). Asplenium gracillimum can sometimes be confused with A. appendiculatum subsp. appendiculatum , but the latter has more coriaceous fronds, always lacks bulbils, has primary pinnae with longer acuminate apices, and has longer indusia (2–8 mm cf. 2–4 mm long). Highly divided forms of A. gracillimum can appear very similar to A. richardii when growing at higher altitudes, but the scales of the latter species are rather longer and narrower than in A. gracillimum . Cytology: n = 144 (Brownsey 1977a). Hybridisation: There is evidence that A. gracillimum hybridises with A. bulbiferum , A. hookerianum , A. obtusatum (Brownsey 1977b), A. appendiculatum subsp. appendiculatum (Brownsey 1983), A. flaccidum subsp. flaccidum , A. lyallii (de Lange et al. 2011), A. appendiculatum subsp. maritimum and A. richardii (newly recorded here). Notes: Typification of Asplenium gracillimum has proved to be difficult. Allan (1961, p. 72) stated that “The type in W[ELT] (Dannevirke. W.C.) is one complete plant” and cited a series of measurements taken from the fronds. However, there are numerous sheets of A. gracillimum in the Colenso Herbarium at WELT; none of them can be unambiguously linked to Allan’s description, and hence his statement does not constitute lectotypification. Brownsey (1977a) identified WELT P003348 as the holotype. However, he later noted that more material had been found (Brownsey 1998), and a series of eight sheets was examined. These proved to be a mixture of A. gracillimum and hybrids between it and A. hookerianum . WELT P003348 was shown to be one of the hybrid plants, and a lectotype (WELT P002858) was selected consistent with the retention of the name A. gracillimum for the species rather than a hybrid. DNA analyses strongly suggest that A. gracillimum is an allopolyploid species derived from A. bulbiferum and A. hookerianum , with multiple independent polyploid origins (Shepherd et al. 2008; Perrie et al. 2010).

"Asplenium hookerianum Colenso, Tasmanian J. Nat. Sci. 2: 169 (1845)",,25-425mm-long; 15-300mm-long; 8-200mm-wide,"Asplenium hookerianum is a terrestrial fern that occurs under open kauri, podocarp, broadleaved, and beech forest, in open kānuka, mānuka, and scrub, under Pinus and Cupressus macrocarpa , and among grass or in open pasture. It grows on well- drained soil, in shingle, on old sand-dunes, among rocks, in rock crevices and on rock faces, in sinkholes and under overhangs, on river terraces, banks and tracksides, among roots and tree bases, on upturned root plates and on dead trunks. It is found on a wide variety of rock types, including greywacke, scoria, schist, serpentine, limestone and marble. Recognition: Asplenium hookerianum is an extremely variable species. Two or more seemingly discrete morphologies can often be found growing together – one with rather broad, often rounded segments, another with very fine, linear segments. Both forms also vary in their degree of dissection from 2-pinnate in small plants to 4-pinnate in large plants. Asplenium hookerianum is similar to small plants of A. gracillimum , but always lacks bulbils and generally has smaller laminae (15–300 mm long, 8–200 mm wide, cf. 60–800 mm long, 24–350 mm wide). Large fronds of A. hookerianum can be distinguished from small fronds of both A. bulbiferum and A. gracillimum by their clearly stalked secondary pinnae. Asplenium hookerianum is more difficult to distinguish from A. richardii , reflecting the fact that the latter is believed to be an autopolyploid derivative of the former (see Notes below). Asplenium richardii is a more robust plant and has pinnae that tend to overlap and spread in three dimensions, whereas A. hookerianum has two-dimensional fronds with pinnae that are well separated, at least in small fronds. The two species have different chromosome numbers and can be distinguished by spore size (44–49 × 32–36 μm in A. richardii cf. 31–37 × 23–27 μm in A. hookerianum ). They are also partially ecologically separated, with A. richardii occurring at generally higher altitudes than A. hookerianum . Cytology: n = 72 (Brownlie 1958; Brownsey 1977a). Hybridisation: There is evidence that A. hookerianum hybridises with A. appendiculatum subsp. appendiculatum , A. bulbiferum , A. flaccidum subsp. flaccidum (Brownsey 1977b), A. oblongifolium (Perrie & Brownsey 2004) and A. gracillimum (newly recorded here). Notes: This taxon was first described by Raoul (1844) as Asplenium adiantoides . However, that name was illegitimate because of two earlier homonyms. It was subsequently described by Colenso (1845), who recognised broad-pinnuled and narrow-pinnuled forms as A. hookerianum and A. colensoi , respectively. Mettenius (1859) proposed A. raoulii as a replacement name for Raoul’s A. adiantoides , but in so doing he cited A. hookerianum and A. colensoi in the synonymy of A. raoulii var. minus and A. raoulii var. colensoi , and thus also in the synonymy of A. raoulii itself. The name A. raoulii is 39therefore nomenclaturally superfluous because either A. hookerianum or A. colensoi should have been used instead. Because A. adiantoides Raoul and A. raoulii Mett. are illegitimate, the names A. adiantoides var. colensoi (Colenso) Hook.f., A. adiantoides var. hookerianum (Colenso) Hook.f., A. adiantoides var. minus Hook.f., A. raoulii var. colensoi (Colenso) Mett., and A. raoulii var. minus (Hook.f.) Mett. are all incorrectly formed and cannot be used, even though the varietal epithets themselves are legitimate. A minor mystery surrounds Colenso’s apparent defiance of protocol in naming A. colensoi after himself. Earp (2018) has summarised this, but concludes that any explanation is necessarily speculative. Asplenium rotundifolium was described by Ettingshausen (1864) from material collected “in Nova Zeelandia”, but without any other details, such as collector or date. As far as is known, Ettingshausen never visited New Zealand, so the name is unlikely to have been based on his own collections. In the protologue, “ Tarachia rotundifolia Presl” is cited in synonymy, but that name has never been published. A specimen in W is labelled “ Tarachia rotundifolia Presl”, was collected by Hügel in New Zealand, and, in the absence of any other original material is the presumed holotype of Asplenium rotundifolium . The material is clearly A. hookerianum . The broad-pinnuled and narrow-pinnuled forms of A. hookerianum have been accepted as varieties in all New Zealand Floras since 1867 (Hooker 1864; Cheeseman 1906, 1925; Allan 1961), or as full species by other authors (e.g. Crookes 1963). However, following Brownsey (1977a), recent treatments have accepted only A. hookerianum as one polymorphic species (Brownsey et al. 1985; Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth 2000). Using AFLP DNA-fingerprinting and chloroplast DNA sequencing Perrie & Brownsey (2005a) showed that genetic variation in A. hookerianum is not concordant with pinnule morphology, and that plants from the same site, irrespective of their pinnule morphology, are generally more closely related to each other than they are to plants with the same pinnule morphology from other sites. They concluded that there was no justification for recognising the narrow-pinnuled form as var. colensoi . Shepherd et al. (2007, 2009) showed that A. hookerianum has extensive chloroplast DNA variation, with at least 25 different haplotypes, suggesting that it is an old lineage which survived the last glacial period in widespread and possibly large populations. This, together with its preference for dry habitats, may account for the fact that A. hookerianum is implicated in more polyploid lineages than any other New Zealand species (Shepherd et al. 2008); it may also account for at least some of the morphological variation. Analysis of low-copy nuclear DNA sequences suggests that A. hookerianum is one tetraploid parent of four allopolyploid species, A. cimmeriorum , A. gracillimum , A. lyallii , and A. appendiculatum , and the sole parent of the autopolyploid species A. richardii . In Australia A. hookerianum is known from two small populations in Victoria and two in Tasmania (Brownsey 1998; Perrie et al. 2010). In contrast to New Zealand populations, only two haplotypes have been recorded (Perrie et al. 2010). The pattern of haplotype variation in Australia is consistent with two independent dispersals of A. hookerianum from New Zealand to Australia, a finding that is unique in trans-Tasman dispersal of vascular plants. Shepherd et al. (2009) demonstrated the presence of two haplotypes in populations of A. hookerianum on the Chatham Islands. Each was more closely related to haplotypes found in mainland New Zealand than they were to each other. Shepherd et al. (2009) concluded that populations of A. hookerianum on the Chathams are derived from at least two long-distance dispersal events, indicating that the species has dispersed over a significant distance both east and west. 40Fig. 77 : Asplenium hookerianum .

"Asplenium lamprophyllum Carse, Trans. & Proc. New Zealand Inst. 56: 81 (1926)",,210-820mm-long; 100mm-long,"Asplenium lamprophyllum is usually a terrestrial fern, or rarely a low epiphyte, found in open podocarp and broadleaved forest, where it may carpet extensive areas over rocks and boulders, rotting logs, clay banks, and stream banks. It is found on steep slopes and well-drained soils, occurring on a variety of rock types, including lava, rhyolite, ignimbrite, and limestone. Recognition: Asplenium lamprophyllum is characterised by its creeping rhizomes, thick-walled scales, glossy green adaxial lamina surfaces, and characteristic smell of oil of wintergreen when crushed. It is similar to A. bulbiferum but distinguished by its creeping rhizome, thick-walled scales, glossy and less divided laminae, longer sori (2–10 mm cf. 2–4 mm long), and absence of bulbils. The specimens at the extreme lower end of the range of variation in the description are very small fronds found at the southern margin of the species distribution (e.g. WELT P027345, CHR 553588). Rare aberrant forms are found with much longer and more divided primary pinnae, and narrower secondary pinnae. Cytology: n = 72 (Brownlie 1961a; Brownsey 1977a). Hybridisation: Asplenium lamprophyllum occasionally hybridises with A. bulbiferum (Brownsey 1977b). Fig. 86 : Asplenium lamprophyllum .

"Asplenium lepidotum Perrie & Brownsey, New Zealand J. Bot. 54: 384 (2016)",,120-1100mm-long; 125mm; 65mm,"Asplenium lepidotum is rupestral on rocks, bluffs, and outcrops, often of limestone, but also other base-rich substrates, including marble and mudstone. It has been recorded rarely as an epiphyte on Dacrycarpus dacrydioides , albeit within areas of limestone. It occurs in coastal areas but most low elevation records of 10–20 m are at least 500 m from the coast. The accompanying vegetation is usually small broadleaved trees and shrubs, but occasionally beech or podocarp forest. It is often in open sites. Recognition: The abundance of scales on the adaxial surface of the pinnae, especially on young fronds, readily distinguishes Asplenium lepidotum from A. oblongifolium and A. obtusatum , as well as from A. decurrens and A. scleroprium , and some plants of A. lyallii . Care should be taken when looking for scales as they can be lost in older fronds. The distribution of A. lepidotum overlaps broadly with both A. oblongifolium and A. obtusatum , but there is no overlap in the distribution of A. lepidotum with either A. decurrens or A. scleroprium . Large plants of A. lepidotum are most likely to be confused with A. oblongifolium because of their shared inland habitats and pinnae with acute apices. Asplenium lepidotum can be distinguished by its abundant scales on adaxial surfaces of the pinnae, its broader rachis scales, the weakly or non- reticulate perine, and generally larger spore size (37–42 × 23–28 μm cf. 33–38 × 20–24 μm). In addition to the abundance of scales on adaxial surfaces of the pinnae, A. lepidotum and A. obtusatum are ecologically separated, with A. obtusatum restricted to the coast and A. lepidotum extending far inland. Asplenium lepidotum rarely, if ever, occurs in open coastal habitats. Asplenium lepidotum is easily distinguished from plants of A. lyallii that are 2-pinnate or lacking scales on the adaxial surface of their pinnae. However, both characters are variable in A. lyallii . Small plants of A. lepidotum can closely resemble 1-pinnate plants of A. lyallii with abundant scales on the adaxial surface of their pinnae. They can still usually be separated by the smaller spore size (37–42 × 23–28 μm cf. 40–54 × 27–35 μm) and less divided terminal pinna of A. lepidotum . The morphological overlap of A. lepidotum and A. lyallii is reinforced by their shared preference for base-rich substrates. They are known to grow together at Tākaka Hill and near Īnangahua, and to occur in very close proximity on the Heaphy Track, near Mt Owen, and in the Bryant Range. A further distinguishing feature of A. lepidotum is that it sometimes produces undivided fronds that are larger than those recorded for A. lyallii , A. oblongifolium , or A. obtusatum . Lamina lengths for undivided fronds reach 125 mm in A. lepidotum , but only 12 mm in A. lyallii , 75 mm in A. oblongifolium , and 12 mm in A. obtusatum . Conversely, the shortest lamina length in a pinnate frond is 65 mm in A. lepidotum , but 8 mm in A. lyallii , 44 mm in A. oblongifolium , and 21 mm in A. obtusatum . Cytology: Unknown, but presumed to be tetraploid (n = 72) based on spore size. Hybridisation: There is evidence that A. lepidotum hybridises with A. flaccidum subsp. flaccidum , and possibly also with A. appendiculatum subsp. appendiculatum (Perrie & Brownsey 2016). 45Fig. 93 : Asplenium lepidotum .

Asplenium lyallii (Hook.f.),,1160mm-long,"Asplenium lyallii is a terrestrial fern found frequently on limestone, marble, or calcareous mudstone or sandstone, but also on greywacke, and on andesite and basalt in the western Waikato. It grows under open broadleaved, beech and kānuka forest, amongst the roots of Corynocarpus laevigatus , with Phormium on coastal cliffs, in coastal scrub, among coastal rocks, and on sand. At higher altitudes it occurs on mossy boulders under forest, on river banks, or in the open on rocky ground, on banks, on cliffs, in rock crevices, under overhangs and around caves. Recognition: Asplenium lyallii is an extremely variable species showing a wide range of frond size, colour and dissection. Plants growing in sheltered lowland habitats tend to produce large 2-pinnate fronds with dark glossy-green adaxial surfaces, whereas plants in exposed situations at high altitudes have much smaller 1-pinnate fronds that are dull grey-green on both surfaces. Usually the proximal pinnae are at least lobed or divided acroscopically, but in very small plants the pinnae can be undivided and lacking lobes. Small 1-pinnate fronds can be confused with A. lepidotum or small fronds of A. oblongifolium and A. obtusatum , but A. lyallii has larger spores than the other species. The stipe scales of A. oblongifolium are also narrower, with longer filiform apices, and scales are absent from the adaxial pinna surfaces. Plants of A. obtusatum have generally thicker fronds and are strictly coastal in habitat. Cytology: n = 144 (Brownlie 1958; Brownsey 1977a). Hybridisation: There is evidence that A. lyallii hybridises with A. appendiculatum subsp. appendiculatum , A. obtusatum (Brownsey 1977b), A. chathamense (Brownsey 1985), A. flaccidum subsp. flaccidum and A. gracillimum (de Lange et al. 2011). Notes: Allan (1961) treated this species as A. anomodum Colenso but observed in the supplementary notes that the name A. lyallii (Hook.f.) T.Moore, based on A. lucidum var. lyallii Hook.f., would take precedence if accepted at the species level. However, Asplenium lucidum G. Forst. is a later homonym of A. lucidum Burm.f. and therefore illegitimate. The names A. lucidum var. lyallii Hook. and A. lucidum var. anomodum are incorrectly formed and cannot be used. Nevertheless, the varietal epithets are legitimate and var. lyallii Hook.f. can be used as the basionym for A. lyallii . Brownsey (1978) showed that Asplenium triste , which had previously been thought to be a synonym of A. bulbiferum , was actually a synonym of A. lyallii . It is the earliest published name for the latter species (Raoul 1844), but is illegitimate because of an earlier homonym. The combination A. bulbiferum var. triste (Raoul) Hook.f. is therefore also illegitimate. 48Analysis of low-copy nuclear DNA sequences suggests that A. lyallii is an allopolyploid species derived from A. hookerianum and either A. oblongifolium or A. obtusatum (Shepherd et al. 2008), although the subsequently described A. lepidotum should also be considered (Perrie & Brownsey 2016).

"Asplenium oblongifolium Colenso, Tasmanian J. Nat. Sci. 2: 171 (1845)",,70-1400mm-long,"Asplenium oblongifolium is usually a terrestrial or rupestral species, but is sometimes found growing epiphytically on tree trunks. It has been recorded growing on Cyathea medullaris , C. smithii , Dicksonia squarrosa , Coprosma chathamica , Cordyline spp., Metrosideros spp., Vitex lucens , and Carex secta stumps, as well as hanging from Astelia clumps. It occurs in kauri, podocarp, broadleaved, and beech forest, under mānuka, kānuka, Cupressus , and Pinus , on coastal cliffs and in coastal scrub, among Phormium , under gorse, and in grassland and open areas. It grows on the ground, on stream banks, among roots, on rocks, cliffs, banks, in road cuttings, on scoria and lava, on sand dunes, on rotten logs and stumps, sometimes in close proximity to the sea. Recognition: Asplenium oblongifolium is morphologically very similar to both A. obtusatum and A. decurrens , both of which have 1-pinnate laminae. It is distinguished by its thinner fronds, usually more acuminate pinnae, longer terminal pinna, hair-like rather than ovate stipe scales, and reticulate perispores. All three species can occupy coastal habitats, but unlike A. oblongifolium , neither A. obtusatum nor A. decurrens extend into inland areas. Asplenium oblongifolium can also be confused with A. lepidotum and with small, 1-pinnate fronds of A. lyallii . It can be distinguished from A. lepidotum by its scales, which are more hair-like and generally absent from the adaxial pinna surfaces, and from 1-pinnate fronds of A. lyallii by its smaller spores (33–38 × 20–24 μm cf. 40–54 × 27–35 μm) and reticulate perispores. Occasional aberrant forms have a greatly enlarged basal acrosopic lobe on the primary pinnae, or primary pinnae that are divided into numerous lobes; such forms are rarely fertile. Crested fronds dividing repeatedly at the apices are also known. Cytology: n = 72 (Brownlie 1958; Brownsey 1977a). Hybridisation: There is evidence that A. oblongifolium hybridises with A. bulbiferum , A. flaccidum subsp. flaccidum , A. flaccidum subsp. haurakiense , A. decurrens (as A. obtusatum subsp. northlandicum ) (Brownsey 1977b), and A. hookerianum (Perrie & Brownsey 2004). The combination A. oblongifolium × shuttleworthianum was recorded from Macauley Island in the southern Kermadec Islands by de Lange (2015a), but the specimen (AK 325824) is morphologically much closer to specimens of A. flaccidum × shuttleworthianum . However, A. flaccidum has not yet been recorded from the southern Kermadecs, and the identity of the hybrid remains in doubt. Some of the plants included in the cultivar “Maori Princess” may result from a hybrid between either A. oblongifolium or A. obtusatum and A. bulbiferum . Notes: The long accepted name Asplenium lucidum Forst.f., used by Allan (1961), was shown to be a later homonym of A. lucidum Burm.f. and therefore illegitimate. It was rejected in favour of A. oblongifolium Colenso by Brownsey (1979a). Combinations based on Forster’s name are also illegitimate. The name A. lucidum var. paucifolium Hook. is incorrectly formed and cannot be used, even though the varietal epithet is legitimate. 51Asplenium obtusatum var. integrifolium Szyszyl. was described from Takapuna, Auckland. The apices of the upper pinnae were described as acuminate, and, together with the locality, this suggests that the plant was actually A. oblongifolium . However, Cheeseman (1906, 1925) did not mention this variety, and Allan (1961) merely listed it in the supplementary notes. No material is present in Szyszylowicz’s main herbarium in W (Amin Loecker, email 23.6.2016). In the absence of original material it is therefore impossible to be certain about its true identity. Analysis of low-copy nuclear DNA sequences suggests that either A. oblongifolium or A. obtusatum is one tetraploid parent of the allopolyploid species A. lyallii and A. decurrens (as A. northlandicum ) (Shepherd et al. 2008).

"Asplenium obtusatum G.Forst., Fl. Ins. Austr. 80 (1786)",,60-1000mm-long,"In the northern part of its range Asplenium obtusatum is a rather small plant growing on exposed coastal rocks, often in seepages or sometimes amongst coastal grasses, but in the south it grows much more luxuriantly on exposed cliffs and under coastal forest or scrub with Phormium , Veronica elliptica , and Blechnum blechnoides or B. durum , where fronds can reach up to 1 m long. On Stewart Island and in the subantarctic, A. obtusatum grows under Olearia lyallii and Metrosideros umbellata . Nowhere does it extend beyond the influence of salt spray. Recognition: Asplenium obtusatum is morphologically very similar to A. decurrens and A. oblongifolium . It occupies a similar coastal habitat to A. decurrens and is only distinguished by its slightly larger laminae (27–540 mm long, 23–290 mm wide, cf. 23–370 mm long, 15–160 mm wide), broader stipe scales, smaller spores (40–43 × 24–27 μm cf. 45–52 × 29–33 μm) and tetraploid chromosome number. However, the two species are geographically separated, A. decurrens occurring north of the western Waikato coast and A. obtusatum only south of Kapiti Island. Asplenium obtusatum is distinguished from A. oblongifolium by its thick fleshy fronds, often rather round-ended pinnae, and narrowly ovate, rather than hair-like, stipe scales. Both species can occupy coastal habitats, but A. obtusatum does not extend into inland areas. In the subantarctic and southern South Island A. obtusatum occurs together with A. scleroprium in coastal regions. Asplenium obtusatum is distinguished by its less deeply serrate and more obtuse pinnae, and sori that do not reach the margins. Asplenium obtusatum can occasionally be confused with small 1-pinnate plants of A. lyallii . However, they generally have thicker, fleshier fronds, occupy a strictly coastal habitat, and have a less divided terminal pinna. Plants of A. obtusatum produce their largest fronds on the islands of Foveaux Strait and the subantarctic. They gradually diminish in size northwards, with only rather small plants occurring around Wellington. This is in contrast to plants of A. decurrens , which produce their largest fronds on the Kermadec and Three Kings Islands, gradually decreasing in size southwards. Cytology: n = 72 (Brownlie 1958; Brownsey 1977a). Hybridisation: There is evidence that A. obtusatum hybridises with A. bulbiferum , A. chathamense , A. flaccidum subsp. flaccidum , A. lyallii (Brownsey 1977b), and A. gracillimum (newly recorded here). Some of the plants included in the cultivar “Maori Princess” may result from a hybrid between either A. oblongifolium or A. obtusatum and A. bulbiferum . Notes: The name Asplenium obliquum G.Forst., and combinations based on it, were treated as synonyms of A. obtusatum G.Forst. by Brownsey (1977a). However, the combination A. lucidum var. obliquum (G.Forst.) T.Moore is incorrectly formed and cannot be used because the species name, A. lucidum G.Forst., is a later homonym of A. lucidum Burm.f. and therefore illegitimate (Brownsey 1979a). 54Asplenium obtusatum was previously considered to include both subsp. obtusatum and subsp. northlandicum (Brownsey 1977a). However, Shepherd et al. (2008) showed that A. decurrens (as A. northlandicum ) is an allopolyploid species, with either A. obtusatum or A. oblongifolium as the chloroplast parent and an unknown tetraploid as the other parent. Their conclusion supported the recognition of A. decurrens as a distinct octoploid species, rather than a subspecies of the tetraploid A. obtusatum . Fig. 118 : Asplenium obtusatum .

"Asplenium pauperequitum Brownsey & P.J.Jacks., New Zealand J. Bot. 22: 315 (1984)",,40-270mm-long,"Asplenium pauperequitum is a rupestral species that grows in seepages and crevices, and on damp surfaces of rhyolitic rock on the Poor Knights Islands, either on exposed bluffs or under a coastal forest canopy of Metrosideros excelsa . On Chatham Island it was recorded growing under a schist overhang, and on the Forty Fours it grew in a deep rock crevice near the summit of the island (Cameron et al. 2006). Plants are often associated with guano or seabird roosts and nest. The species appears to be naturally prone to major population fluctuations (de Lange et al. 2010). Recognition: Asplenium pauperequitum is readily distinguished from most New Zealand species by its thin, shiny, red-brown stipe and rachis. All other species, except A. trichomanes , A. polyodon , and the naturalised A. aethiopicum , have stipes and rachises that are green at least in the distal part. Asplenium pauperequitum is distinguished by its primary pinnae, which are either trilobed or divided into a single pair of secondary pinnae, whereas in A. trichomanes and A. polyodon the fronds are 1 ‑pinnate with many more pairs of pinnae. In A. aethiopicum the laminae are at least 2-pinnate and also have many more pairs of pinnae. Cytology: n = c. 144 (Brownsey & Jackson 1984). Hybridisation: Asplenium pauperequitum is unusual among New Zealand species of the genus in that it has not been recorded hybridising with any other species. Its isolated phylogenetic position in Clade IX of Ohlsen et al. (2014b), in contrast to most New Zealand species, which occur in Clade V, may account for this. 56Notes: There is a remarkable disjunction between the populations of A. pauperequitum on the Poor Knights Islands and those on the Chatham Islands, which may be due to dispersal of spores by seabirds (Cameron et al. 2006).

"Asplenium polyodon G.Forst., Fl. Ins. Austr. 80 (1786)",,115-1640mm-long,"Asplenium polyodon occurs in kauri, podocarp, broadleaved, beech and coastal forest, under mānuka and kānuka, and under Pinus . In the northern part of its range it is usually epiphytic on living trees and on old stumps or logs, or at the bases of trunks, but is sometimes found on the ground, on lava or on thermally heated soil. Further south it also grows terrestrially on soil, rocks, banks, streamsides, cliff faces, and among Phormium . It has been recorded growing epiphytically on Cyathea dealbata , C. smithii , Dicksonia squarrosa , Beilschmiedia tawa , Elaeocarpus dentatus , Fuchsia excorticata , Kunzea spp., Melicytus ramiflorus , Metrosideros spp., Pinus spp., Rhopalostylis sapida , Sophora spp., Vitex lucens , and Weinmannia racemosa and hanging from clumps of Astelia . Recognition: Asplenium polyodon is recognised by its long arching or pendent fronds, 1-pinnate laminae, its dark brown and very scaly stipes and rachises, and its pinnae, which are doubly serrate with an enlarged basal acroscopic lobe. Cytology: 2n = 144 (Brownsey 1977a). Hybridisation: Asplenium polyodon is unusual among New Zealand species of the genus in that it has not been recorded hybridising with any other species, despite growing in close proximity to many different taxa (Brownsey 1977b). Its isolated phylogenetic position in Clade VI of Schneider et al. (2004), in contrast to most New Zealand species, which occur in Clade V, may account for this. However, in Australia A. polyodon is known to hybridise with A. attenuatum and A. paleaceum , both of which also occur in Clade VI (Ohlsen et al. 2014a). Notes: The names Asplenium adiantoides (based on Trichomanes adiantoides L.), A. caudatum G.Forst., and A. falcatum Sw., and combinations based on them, have been widely misapplied to A. polyodon in New Zealand. Asplenium caudatum is a widespread species of the tropical Pacific that was said to be present on the Kermadec Islands by Hooker (1864), Cheeseman (1906, 1925), and (as A. falcatum var. caudatum ) by Allan (1961), but is no longer accepted in the New Zealand flora. The correct applications of the names Trichomanes adiantoides L. and A. falcatum Sw. have been 58interpreted differently by different authors, but have now been resolved in a detailed investigation of their nomenclature, typification, and taxonomy by Salgado & Fraser-Jenkins (2013). The proposal by Salgado & Fraser-Jenkins (2014) to reject T. adiantoides L. has been accepted (Applequist 2016), and the name A. aethiopicum (Burm.f.) Bech. will continue to be used for the widespread African, Asian, and Australian species, and the name A. falcatum Lam. will apply to the Sri Lankan and south Indian plant. As a consequence of the rejection of Trichomanes adiantoides L., and combinations based on it, the name A. adiantoides var. polyodon (G.Forst.) C.Chr. is incorrectly formed and cannot be used, even though the varietal epithet is legitimate. Asplenium polyodon G.Forst. is much less widespread than indicated by Brownsey (1998). Salgado & Fraser-Jenkins (2013) suggested that it should be restricted to plants from New Zealand, Australia, and adjacent islands, including New Caledonia, and that it does not apply to plants in Polynesia. However, molecular analysis by Ohlsen et al. (2014) indicates that it is likely to be even more restricted. They identified four related lineages within the Australasian region. One, which includes A. listeri , comprises lithophytes that occur on limestone on Christmas Island, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, and possibly also Tonga. The other three are primarily epiphytic and occur respectively on Christmas Island (and probably elsewhere), in mainland Australia and New Caledonia (and possibly Lord Howe Island), and in New Zealand (and probably also Norfolk Island). Unfortunately the lectotype of A. polyodon (UPS-T 24832), collected by the Forsters in the Pacific, is unlocalised and it is uncertain to which of the clades identified by Ohlsen et al. (2014) it belongs. If it were shown that it belonged to one of the non-New Zealand clades, the plant in New Zealand would require a new name (with A. forsterianum Colenso a likely candidate). However, until that issue is resolved the name A. polyodon is used here in a broad sense for plants in Australasia. Fig. 130 : Asplenium polyodon .

"Asplenium richardii Hook.f., Bot. Antarct. Voy. II (Fl. Nov.-Zel.)",,40-470mm-long,"Asplenium richardii occurs under podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, under kānuka and scrub, and occasionally in subalpine tussock. It grows terrestrially, often among rocks and boulders, on stream banks and rock faces, under rock overhangs, and in rock crevices. It is found on greywacke, andesite, rhyolite, granite, schist, limestone, and marble. Recognition: Asplenium richardii is morphologically similar to both A. hookerianum and A. appendiculatum subsp. appendiculatum but differs from both in having fronds with overlapping pinnae that often spread in three dimensions when fresh. It is a more robust plant than A. hookerianum , and grows at generally higher altitudes; it is also octoploid rather than tetraploid with larger spores (44–49 × 32–36 μm cf. 31–37 × 23–27 μm). It has thinner fronds, shorter indusia (1.5–4 mm, cf. 2–8 mm long), and ultimate segments that are generally narrower (0.5–1 mm, cf. 1–2.5 mm wide) than in A. appendiculatum . Cytology: n = 144 (Brownlie 1954; Brownsey 1977a). Hybridisation: There is evidence that A. richardii hybridises with A. appendiculatum subsp. appendiculatum (Brownsey 1977b) and A. gracillimum (newly recorded here). Notes: The names Asplenium richardii and A. adiantoides var. richardii , based on the same type, were both published by Joseph Hooker just days apart in 1854. However, publication at species rank occurred slightly earlier and therefore takes priority (Brownsey & Perrie 2017b). In any case the combination A. adiantoides var. richardii (Hook.f.) Hook.f. is incorrect and cannot be used because A. adiantoides Raoul is a later homonym and therefore illegitimate, even though the varietal epithet itself is legitimate. Similarly, the combination Asplenium raoulii var. richardii (Hook.f.) Mett. is incorrect and cannot be used because the name A. raoulii was nomeclaturally superfluous when published (see Notes under A. hookerianum ). Allan (1961) indicated that the type of A. richardii was in Achille Richard’s Herbarium at P, a statement repeated by Brownsey (1977a). However, that is incorrect. The species was described and illustrated by J.D. Hooker (in Hooker 1854) based on a specimen that “was given to us by our late friend Professor A. Richard, it formed part of a small collection made at the South extremity of New Zealand by the Captain of a French Whaler”. Hooker further stated that “we have seen no other specimens”. The specimen in K (barcode K 001092539) from New River matches Hooker’s illustration and is therefore the holotype. The specimen itself is not the plant currently known as A. richardii , but is a narrow-pinnuled form of A. gracillimum (Brownsey & Perrie 2017b). Strict interpretation of the Code would mean that the name 61A. richardii should be used for what is currently called A. gracillimum , and that the plant currently called A. richardii would require a new name. However, implementation of these changes would be extremely confusing and a proposal has been submitted to Taxon (Brownsey & Perrie 2017a) to conserve the name A. richardii with a different type from that designated by Hooker (Mt Cook, Black Birch Stream, 11 Feb. 1974, Brownsey NZ 419 , WELT P016203). Until a decision is made, the current nomenclature still applies. If the proposal is rejected, changes to the names of two species and 10 hybrid combinations will be required, as detailed by Brownsey & Perrie (2017b). Analysis of morphology and low-copy nuclear DNA sequences suggests that A. richardii is an autopolyploid species derived from A. hookerianum (Shepherd et al. 2008). Fig. 137 : Asplenium richardii .

"Asplenium scleroprium Hombr. in Hombron & Jacquinot, Voy. Pôle Sud, Bot. t. 1d (1843)",,170-1060mm-long,"Asplenium scleroprium occurs in Veronica elliptica coastal scrub at Bluff and on the Foveaux Strait islands, under Olearia lyallii on the Snares Islands, under Metrosideros umbellata on the Auckland Islands, and in rank flax-land on South-East Island. It grows either near the high-water mark or on coastal cliffs. At Invercargill, plants grow in disturbed vegetation of Podocarpus totara , Cupressus macrocarpa , under pines and willows, and on sandy soil at the water’s edge. Recognition: Asplenium scleroprium is recognised by its thick fleshy fronds, 1-pinnate laminae, deeply serrate pinnae, and sori which extend to the margins at the sinuses. It is rather similar in appearance and occurs in the same habitat as A. obtusatum but is distinguished by its deeply serrate and acuminate pinnae, and sori that reach the margins at the sinuses. Cytology: n = 144 (Brownsey 1977a). Hybridisation: There is evidence that A. scleroprium hybridises with A. flaccidum subsp. flaccidum (Brownsey 1977b). Notes: Asplenium scleroprium Hombr. was treated as A. lucidum var. aucklandicum by Allan (1961). However, the combination A. lucidum var. aucklandicum (Hook.f.) Allan is incorrectly formed and cannot be used because the species name, A. lucidum G.Forst., is a later homonym of A. lucidum Burm.f. and therefore illegitimate (Brownsey 1979a). Similarly, A. lucidum var. scleroprium (Hombr.) T.Moore is incorrectly formed and cannot be used. On the basis of morphology, Asplenium scleroprium was previously suggested to be an allopolyploid derivative of a hybrid between Asplenium flaccidum subsp. flaccidum and A. obtusatum (Brownsey 1977b). However, analysis of low-copy nuclear DNA sequences suggests that A. scleroprium is an allopolyploid species derived from A. obtusatum and either A. chathamense , A. flaccidum subsp. flaccidum , or A. flaccidum subsp. haurakiense (Shepherd et al. 2008). The sequence analysis suggested that the latter was the most likely second parent, but this is anomalous given the non- overlapping distributions of present-day populations of the two putative parents. Further work is needed to determine the second parent. It is possible that this allopolyploid species has originated more than once on different island groups. 63Fig. 142 : Asplenium scleroprium .

"Asplenium shuttleworthianum Kunze, Farrnkräuter 26, t. 14 (1840)",,100-860mm-long; 6mm-long; 1-1.5mm-wide,"On Raoul Island, Asplenium shuttleworthianum grows in fissures and crevices on coastal cliffs and rocks, or under coastal forest on andesite, scoria, or pumiceous ground. On North and South Meyer Islands it grows on tuff slopes in ground burrowed by petrels (Sykes 1977). It varies considerably in size from small, stunted plants in exposed sites to large plants in shaded forest. Recognition: Asplenium shuttleworthianum is recognised by its 2–4-pinnate fronds, with rather short sori confined to the often slightly expanded tips of the ultimate segments. In the New Zealand region the species is known only from the Kermadec Islands. Cytology: n = c.144 (Brownsey 1977a). Hybridisation: There is evidence that A. shuttleworthianum hybridises with A. decurrens (as A. obtusatum subsp. northlandicum ) (Brownsey 1977b) and A. flaccidum sensu lato (newly recorded here). The combination A. oblongifolium × shuttleworthianum was recorded from Macauley Island in the southern Kermadec Islands by de Lange (2015a), but the specimen (AK 325824) is morphologically much closer to specimens of A. flaccidum × shuttleworthianum . However, A. flaccidum has not yet been recorded from the southern Kermadecs, and the identity of the hybrid remains in doubt. Notes: The relationship between Asplenium shuttleworthianum and A. gibberosum and similar forms in the Pacific requires further investigation. Trichomanes gibberosum was described by Forster (1786) from an unknown locality in the Pacific and then treated in Davallia (Swartz 1801) and Loxoscaphe (Moore 1853) before being accepted in Asplenium (Mettenius 1870). It is known from Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga, Rarotonga, Tahiti, and Pitcairn Island, and possibly Samoa, where it is known as A. multifidum , a species originally described from Tahiti (Brackenridge 1854). A more finely divided and proliferous species from Fiji was described as Davallia foeniculacea by Hooker (1861), before being transferred to Loxoscaphe (Moore 1857–1862) and then treated in Asplenium as A. stenolobum (Christensen 1905–1906). A similar-looking plant was described from Samoa as A. powellii by Baker (in Hooker & Baker 1867b). Meanwhiile A. shuttleworthianum was described as a distinct species from Pitcairn Island by Kunze (1840–1851), but never critically compared with material elsewhere in the Pacific, possibly because at that time it was treated in Davallia , or later as Loxoscaphe . Indeed, it was not mentioned in early accounts of the plants of Pitcairn Island (Brown & Brown 1931; Copeland 1938; Brownlie 1961b), which all referred only to the presence of Loxoscaphe gibberosum . Göthesson (1997) listed the species on Pitcairn as Asplenium gibberosum and noted only that some uncertainty seemed to exist as to whether the species should be known as A. gibberosum or A. shuttleworthianum . However, he did not include the latter name in the synonymy. The name A. shuttleworthianum was first used in a New Zealand context by Hooker (1864), who treated it as one of six varieties of A. flaccidum , but one confined to the Kermadec Islands. It was later raised to species rank by Cheeseman (1925), who noted that “it was discovered on Pitcairn Island by Mr Cuming, but has since been found in the Samoan Group and elsewhere in Polynesia”. Sykes (1977) also claimed that “ A. shuttleworthianum is recorded from parts of tropical Polynesia as far east as Pitcairn”. However, identified collections of A. shuttleworthianum have only been collected from Pitcairn Island (Kunze 1840–1851) and the Kermadec Islands (Cheeseman 1925; Allan 1961; Sykes 1977). Such a disjunct distribution seems highly unlikely, and further investigation of the whole complex across the Pacific is needed. 66Measurements of spore size from different Pacific populations of the A. gibberosum/shuttleworthianum aggregate indicate that there are two very different size ranges (Brownsey unpub.). One group, including all the measured populations of A. shuttleworthianum from the Kermadec Islands, has spores in the range of 51–56 × 34–39 μm. This is consistent with the octoploid chromosome number recorded for A. shuttleworthianum from the Kermadecs (Brownsey 1977a). Another group, including most of the populations of A. gibberosum , has smaller spores in the range 39–47 × 26–34 μm. This suggests that these populations may be tetraploid, but no actual chromosome counts have been made from A. gibberosum . It is likely that more than one taxon is included within each spore-size group. Also, it is clear that populations on individual island groups are not homogeneous; different populations from Vanuatu, Rarotonga, and Pitcairn Island fall into the two groups, suggesting both tetraploid and octoploid plants are present. Analysis of chloroplast DNA sequences (Ohlsen et al. 2014b) suggests that A. gibberosum and A. stenolobum from Fiji form a clade that is sister to a clade comprising A. shuttleworthianum from the Kermadec Islands, A. subflexuosum from New Caledonia, and A. gibberosum from Vanuatu. Whilst nothing conclusive can be determined from this, the indications are that the complex is genetically variable in the Pacific. Analysis of low-copy nuclear DNA sequences strongly suggests that A. shuttleworthianum from the Kermadec Islands is an allopolyploid species derived from A. flaccidum and a second, unidentified, species (Shepherd et al. 2008). One possibility is that the second parent belongs to the Flaccidum group of Clade V (Ohlsen et al. 2014b). Until this complex is further investigated it is impossible to be certain whether plants of A. shuttleworthianum from Pitcairn Island and from the Kermadec Islands belong to the same species. If it can be shown that they are not the same, then the plants on the Kermadec Islands will require a new name. Fig. 148 : Asplenium shuttleworthianum .

Asplenium subglandulosum (Hook. & Grev.),,25-135mm-long; 190mm-long,"Asplenium subglandulosum occurs in crevices of open, sunny rock faces or in rocky ground under scrub. It grows in the crevices and fissures of limestone, greywacke, and schist. It is often found with Asplenium flabellifolium , Pellaea calidirupium , and species of Cheilanthes . Recognition: Asplenium subglandulosum is readily distinguished from all other New Zealand species of Asplenium by the dense covering of glandular and non-glandular hairs on both surfaces of the fronds, and the absence of indusia. Cytology: n = 72 (Brownlie 1958). Only tetraploid plants have been recorded in New Zealand, but in Australia Tindale & Roy (2002) reported diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid plants. Hybridisation: Asplenium subglandulosum is unusual among New Zealand species of the genus in that it has not been recorded hybridising with any other species. Its isolated phylogenetic position in Clade III of Schneider et al. (2004), in contrast to most New Zealand species, which occur in Clade V, may account for this. Notes: Allan (1961) treated Asplenium subglandulosum in Pleurosorus , as P. rutifolius (see Taxonomy under Aspleniaceae). In Australia, Brownsey (1998) retained both P. rutifolius and P. subglandulosus as separate species, albeit “with considerable reservation”. However, when treated in Asplenium , the name A. rutifolium based on Brown’s Grammitis rutifolius is preoccupied by A. rutifolium Kunze, and hence A. subglandulosum has priority. 69Salvo et al. (1982) treated Pleurosorus papaverifolius (Kunze) Fée from Chile and Argentina, and P. hispanicus (Cosson) C.V.Morton from Spain and Morocco, as subspecies of Asplenium subglandulosum . We prefer to retain the different geographical populations as separate species, but the status of these taxa, including whether more than one is present in Australia, requires further investigation. Australasian populations show considerable variation in spore size and in the nature and abundance of their hairs (Brownsey 1998), and are known to be diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid (Dawson et al. 2000; Tindale & Roy 2002), whereas Spanish populations are diploid (Salvo et al. 1982). Molecular evidence (Ohlsen et al. 2014b) indicates sequence differences between the populations world-wide. Gymnogramma alpina was described by Potts (1878) from a specimen collected by Mr Gray in the Upper Ashburton District, Canterbury, growing in rock crevices at 3000 ft. No original material has been located in CHR, K, or WELT, but there is one specimen in the Cheeseman Herbarium (AK 135877) labelled “Rangitata Valley, Southern Alps, T.H. Potts ”, and annotated “type of G. alpina Potts” in Cheeseman’s writing. There is no reason to doubt the authenticity of the specimen or label, it accords reasonably well with the protologue, and in the absence of any other original material is the presumed holotype of G. alpina . The material is clearly Asplenium subglandulosum . Given (1972) analysed the ecological requirements of Asplenium subglandulosum (as Pleurosorus rutifolius ) from all the then known New Zealand collections of the species. He also outlined the conservation status of the species at that time. Fig. 155 : Asplenium subglandulosum . Mature plant growing in limestone rock crevice.Fig. 156 : Asplenium subglandulosum .

"Asplenium trichomanes L., Sp. Pl. 1080 (1753)",,25-300mm-long,"Asplenium trichomanes grows most frequently in crevices and fissures of limestone or marble, but also occurs on greywacke, schist, and serpentine. It grows on open exposed rocks, bluffs, cuttings, and banks, under overhangs, or on rock in the shade of podocarp, broadleaved or beech forest, kānuka or mānuka, or under scrub. Occasionally it extends into sub-alpine tussock, and around Kāwhia Harbour it grows close to the sea. Recognition: Asplenium trichomanes is recognised by its dark brown polished stipes and rachises, narrow pinnate fronds, and sessile, oblong, or ovate pinnae. It is similar to A. flabellifolium but readily distinguished by its brown, rather than green, stipes and rachises. It also lacks the characteristic rachises of A. flabellifolium that extend beyond the distal pinnae and root at their tips. Asplenium flabellifolium typically also has flabellate pinnae, while the pinnae of A. trichomanes are oblong to ovate. Cytology: n = 72, 108 (Brownlie 1954; Dawson et al. 2000). Hybridisation: Asplenium trichomanes is unusual among New Zealand species of the genus in that it has not been recorded hybridising with any other species. Its isolated phylogenetic position in Clade XI of Ohlsen et al. (2014b), in contrast to most New Zealand species, which occur in Clade V, may account for this. Notes: Two chromosome races, representing tetraploid and hexaploid forms, have been reported for A. trichomanes in New Zealand (Brownlie 1954; Lovis 1956, 1958; Dawson et al. 2000). Lovis (1956, 1958) noted that the hexaploid could only be distinguished morphologically by the nature of the rhizome scales, which have a broader occluded central midrib than in the tetraploid, and by the size of the spores (34–39 μm long in the tetraploids and 39–47 μm in the hexaploids). Only three collections of the tetraploid were known to Lovis, none of them now represented in New Zealand herbaria, but stated to have come from Tangoio, north-east of Napier, from Pukeora Sanatorium, west of Waipukurau, and from the upper reaches of the Tukipo River. The two cytotypes probably deserve recognition as separate taxa, but whether at specific or subspecific level requires further investigation. The correct names are also in doubt. The hexaploid was described as A. melanolepis by Colenso (1888), but this name is illegitimate because of an earlier homonym, and the taxon requires a new name at either specific or subspecific rank. The diploid taxon in Europe has traditionally been known as A. trichomanes L. or A. trichomanes subsp. trichomanes (Lovis 1964), and the tetraploid taxon as either A. trichomanes subsp. quadrivalens D.E.Mey. or A. quadrivalens (D.E.Mey.) Landolt (Meyer 1962; Landolt 2010). A lectotype 72for A. trichomanes L. was designated in this sense by Viane (in Jonsell & Jarvis 1994), but his selection is pre-dated by Bobrov (1984), who designated a tetraploid specimen in LINN as the lectotype (see Youxing & Viane 2013). If confirmed, Linnaeus’s name would therefore apply to the tetraploid taxon and not to the diploid. Youxing & Viane (2013) indicated that a proposal might be made to conserve the name A. trichomanes sensu stricto with a conserved type. Pending such a proposal, we use the name A. trichomanes here in a broad sense to encompass both the cytotypes present in New Zealand. The tetraploid taxon is widely distributed in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia (Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania), but the hexaploid is known only from New Zealand, apart from a single collection from ACT, Australia (Brownsey 1977a, 1998).

Blechnum banksii (Hook.f.),25-400mm-long,,"Blechnum banksii is a terrestrial fern confined to damp rocks, overhangs, rock crevices, shaded seepages, or stream banks close to the sea, and is classified as a salt-spray species (Chambers & Farrant 1996a). It often grows under Coprosma repens , Brachyglottis rotundifolia , Veronica elliptica , Phormium species, or Olearia scrub, and is frequently associated with Asplenium obtusatum or, in the far south, with Blechnum durum . In the subantarctic it occurs in Poa litorosa tussock . It grows more abundantly and luxuriantly on the west coast and in the far south. Recognition: Blechnum banksii is distinguished by its dimorphic fronds, free veins, pinnatisect sterile laminae, and continuous sori. It is exclusively coastal in habitat, and has slightly fleshy fronds. The sterile laminae are linear to narrowly obovate, with triangular to orbicular pinnae that are rounded to obtuse at their apices, entire or slightly crenate on their margins and adnate at their bases. The basal pinnae are arranged alternately. The laminae are glabrous and darker green on their adaxial surfaces, and the fertile fronds are generally shorter than the sterile. Blechnum banksii is likely to be confused only with B. chambersii or B. durum , both of which occur in coastal habitats. Compared to B. chambersii ​​​​​​, its sterile laminae are narrower (5–40 mm wide, cf. 15–110 mm wide) and more fleshy. It can be distinguished from B. durum by its smaller sterile laminae (30–440 mm long, 5–40 mm wide, cf. 140–650 mm long, 22–115 mm wide), less crowded fertile pinnae and concolorous rhizome scales that lack black margins. Cytology: 2n = 66 (Chambers 1954; Chambers & Farrant 1996a​​​​​​). 7Hybridisation: A possible hybrid between Blechnum banksii and B. chambersii has been collected from South Westland, Ship Creek, south of Tauperikaka Point, D.R. Given 127012 , CHR 420408. No spores are present to confirm the hybrid nature of the plant. Notes: Chambers & Farrant (1996a) suggested that plants referred to Blechnum banksii , based on New Zealand material, and B. blechnoides and B. leyboldtianum (Phil.) C.Chr., based on Chilean material, all belonged to the same taxon. The name they used for this taxon was “ Blechnum blechnoides (Bory) Keyserl.”. However, the basionym, Lomaria blechnoides Bory, is illegitimate, being a later homonym of Lomaria blechnoides Desv. Blechnum blechnoides Keyserl. is a nomen novum (Art. 58.1, Ex. 1), and legitimate, but dates from 1873, and is therefore a more recent name than either B. banksii published in 1854, or B. leyboldtianum published in 1861. Although Chambers & Farrant (1996a) regarded New Zealand and Chilean material as conspecific, Rodríguez Ríos (2015) suggested that the plants in the two areas are morphologically rather different, and that they should be recognised as B. banksii in New Zealand and B. leyboldtianum in Chile. However, neither author provided quantitative morphological evidence for their conclusions, and further investigation is needed to determine the status of these taxa. Regardless of the outcome, the correct name for the plant in New Zealand is B. banksii , and because material in the two countries is superficially similar, we treat the species in New Zealand as non-endemic until definitive evidence is produced to the contrary.

"Blechnum chambersii Tindale in Beadle et al., Fl. Sydney Region 86 (1972)",85-620mm-long,,"Blechnum chambersii is a terrestrial fern found under kauri, podocarp, broadleaved or beech forest, under mānuka, kānuka and coastal scrub, and under Salix species in swampy areas. It grows in rock crevices, under overhangs, on damp rock walls, near waterfalls, on rocky banks and roadside banks, on the forest floor, on stream banks in wet gullies, and rarely as a low epiphyte, usually favouring shaded habitats. Recognition: Blechnum chambersii is recognised by its dimorphic fronds, free veins, pinnatisect sterile laminae, and continuous sori. The sterile laminae are narrowly elliptic to narrowly obovate, with oblong to almost triangular pinnae that are usually acute at their apices, shallowly crenate on the margins, and adnate at their bases. The basal pinnae are alternate or sub-opposite. The laminae are glabrous and a similar colour on both surfaces. The sterile fronds form a prostrate to suberect rosette with the fertile fronds held upright in the centre, the fertile usually a little shorter than the sterile. Blechnum chambersii is very similar to B. membranaceum , the two species hybridising in areas of overlap, but plants of B. chambersii can be distinguished by their generally broader laminae (15–115 mm wide, cf. 8–40 mm wide), elliptic rather than obovate outline, shallowly toothed pinnae, which are alternate at the base of the lamina rather than in opposite pairs, and by their fertile fronds which are a little shorter, not longer, than the sterile fronds. B. chambersii is also similar to B. banksii but can be distinguished by its sterile laminae, which are generally broader (15–115 mm wide, cf. 5–40 mm wide) and never fleshy. Blechnum norfolkianum is closely related to B. chambersii , differing principally in its larger fronds, wider laminae, shiny green colour, more acuminate pinna apices, and oblong basal flanges. In B. chambersii the sterile laminae are 15–115 mm wide and the longest pinnae 14–60 mm long, compared to 70–250 mm wide and 50–125 mm long in B. norfolkianum . The fertile laminae are 10–70 mm wide and the longest pinnae 5–40 mm long in B. chambersii , and 50–190 mm wide and 25–100 mm long in B. norfolkianum . The lamina length:width ratio is c. 3–5:1 in sterile fronds and c. 2–5:1 in fertile fronds of B. norfolkianum compared to ratios of c. 4–6.5:1 and c. 5–10:1 respectively in B. chambersii. Very large fronds of B. chambersii resembling B. norfolkianum are found in some places between Auckland and Tauranga, but they can usually be distinguished by the length:width ratio of the laminae. Occasional aberrant forms of B. chambersii are found, including fronds with very long, narrow laminae, sterile laminae with occasional fertile pinnae, and crested forms. Cytology: 2n = 66 (Chambers 1954 – as B. lanceolatum ). Hybridisation: There is evidence for hybridisation between Blechnum chambersii and B. membranaceum (see Blechnum ×aggregatum ; Tindale 1960). 10It is likely that B. chambersii hybridises with B. norfolkianum on offshore islands where the two species often occur together, and where they are sometimes hard to distinguish. However, no sign of spore abortion has been seen in plants of intermediate morphology, and conclusive evidence of hybridisation is lacking. Notes: Allan (1961) treated this species as B. lanceolatum (R.Br.) J.W.Sturm, but that name is pre- occupied by B. lanceolatum Raddi. When treated in Austroblechnum , the correct name is A. lanceolatum. DNA sequences for a single chloroplast locus from New Zealand Blechnum chambersii and B. norfolkianum were found to be identical, whereas one of two B. membranaceum samples differed by one base pair (Shepherd et al. 2007). Wilson (2012), using DNA sequences from three chloroplast loci, found samples of B. membranaceum and B. norfolkianum from New Zealand, and Australian and New Zealand B. chambersii , to differ by up to seven base pairs, but with no strongly supported relationships among them. The two studies indicate that all three taxa are very closely related. B. chambersii has been reported from Fiji (Brownlie 1977, as Blechnum doodioides (Brack.) Brownlie; Nakamura 2008; Brownsey & Perrie 2011), but plants from there have much wider fertile fronds, as well as DNA sequence differences (Perrie et al. 2014). It is likely that they belong to a different species. Fig. 9 : Blechnum chambersii .

Blechnum colensoi (Hook.f.),85-280mm-long; 2-6mm-wide,,"Blechnum colensoi is a terrestrial fern found under podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, usually in damp, shaded habitats. It grows on rock walls, steep-sided gullies, stream banks, track banks, on the forest floor, and sometimes on shingle slips. It is frequently found hanging from steep banks close to waterfalls. Recognition: Blechnum colensoi is distinguished by its strongly dimorphic fronds, free veins, pinnatisect sterile laminae, and continuous sori. The sterile laminae are glabrous, obovate, dark green on the adaxial surface but paler abaxially, divided into 1–11 pairs of very broad, decurrent pinnae in the distal half and several pairs of tiny flanges proximally. The sterile fronds contrast markedly with the fertile fronds, which have very narrow pinnae. The sterile fronds are sometimes entire in juvenile plants. B. colensoi is a plant of dark, wet habitats and the laminae are often covered in epiphyllous bryophytes. Cytology: 2n = 122 (Murray & de Lange 2013).

Blechnum deltoides (Colenso),,,"Blechnum deltoides is usually a terrestrial fern found in podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, under mānuka and kānuka, in rough pasture, and in subalpine scrub. Very rarely it occurs as a low epiphyte on beech. It grows on rock outcrops and cliffs, on road banks, on stream banks and terraces, on the forest floor, and on banks beside the sea. Recognition: Blechnum deltoides is distinguished by its dimorphic fronds, free veins, pinnatisect sterile laminae, and continuous sori. The sterile laminae are usually ovate with pinnae that are adnate and reduce in size only slightly at the base of the lamina. The basal pair of pinnae are opposite, often strongly falcate, and tend to point basiscopically. The stipes are rough and bear linear, dark brown scales. The rachises and abaxial surfaces are usually covered in white to fawn-coloured hairs up to 2 mm long, unlike any other New Zealand species, although in a few populations they are glabrous. Fertile and sterile fronds on individual plants are about equal in length. Blechnum deltoides is distinctive amongst the species with pinnatisect sterile laminae in that the basal pinna segments are only slightly reduced. Cytology: n = 34 (Brownlie 1954 – as Blechnum vulcanicum ). A count of n = 33 has been reported in Australia (Tindale & Roy 2002 – as Blechnum vulcanicum ). Notes: Chambers & Farrant (2012) noted that the taxonomy of the Blechnum vulcanicum aggregate was complex, and that the whole group could either be regarded as one species, or divided into several taxa. Subsequently, Chambers & Wilson (2019) revised the B. vulcanicum group and recognised 13 species in Blechnum sect. Pilosa in Malesia, Australasia and Oceania. Under this classification, accepted here, Blechnum vulcanicum sens. str. was considered to be confined to Malesia, and the species in Australia and New Zealand referred to B. deltoides. Ten other species were recognised in the Pacific region. Most plants in New Zealand are covered on the abaxial lamina surfaces in white to fawn-coloured hairs. However, Chambers & Wilson (2019) noted that in several populations from the western side of the South Island, as well as those in south-eastern Australia, the hairs on mature fronds were confined to the region of the basal stipe scales. Chambers & Wilson (2019) argued that WELT P003239, the specimen inadvertently selected as the lectotype of Blechnum deltoides by Allan (1961), should be considered the holotype, with an isotype at Kew (K 001092698). Similarly, they argued that WELT P003238, the specimen inadvertently selected as lectotype of B. deflexa by Allan (1961), is the holotype, and K 001092697 the isotype. They state that “The documentation presented by St George (2009: 163) indicates unquestionably that the specimens of both taxa sent by Colenso to Hooker were part of the same gathering as those in WELT”. However, in designating lectotypes in this Flora, we have consistently taken the view that Colenso’s collections in K and WELT cannot be assumed to be from the same gathering, and must therefore be considered syntypes. Even if they could be shown to be from the same gathering, it is not possible to say which is the holotype, and which the isotype. Colenso never indicated a holotype, nor the herbarium where the specimen was deposited. Furthermore, in this particular instance the type 16specimens of Blechnum deltoides and B. deflexa are mounted on the same sheet, and it is far from clear which label relates to which specimens. The label for Lomaria deltoides appears to relate to the frond at the bottom of the sheet, but the Kew barcode has been applied so that it also includes the right-hand specimen. When compared to the specimens at WELT, the fronds of L. deflexa at K are much larger, and almost certainly did not come from the same gathering. This raises the possibility that the labels on the Kew sheet may have become muddled. Whatever the real history of these specimens, it seems safer to accept Allan’s lectotypifications of the specimens at WELT, which are clearly segregated on different sheets.

Blechnum discolor (G.Forst.),260-1380mm-long,,"Blechnum discolor is a terrestrial fern found in kauri, podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, under mānuka, kānuka and coastal scrub, sometimes in rough pasture, and occasionally under Salix species. It grows on the forest floor, on old stumps, on slopes, on stream banks and river terraces, on tracksides, on roadside banks, and in dune hollows. It favours more open areas, and often forms extensive colonies by means of its stoloniferous habit. Recognition: Blechnum discolor is distinguished by its dimorphic fronds, free veins, pinnatisect sterile laminae, and continuous sori. It has erect rhizomes that sometimes form a short, woody trunk. Plants often develop into extensive colonies by means of stolons that grow from the rhizomes. The sterile laminae are glabrous, narrowly elliptic, dark green on the upper surface but paler below, and divided into 20–62 pairs of narrowly oblong, acute pinnae that reduce gradually in length to each end of the lamina. The fertile fronds are generally longer and narrower than the sterile, and show a marked transition from entirely fertile pinnae at the lamina apex to entirely sterile at the base. The sterile fronds grow out in the form of a crown, with the fertile fronds held stiffly upright in the centre. Occasional aberrant crested or bipinnate forms are found.

Blechnum durum (T.Moore),110-675mm-long,,"Blechnum durum is a terrestrial fern of salt-spray, confined to damp rocks, boulders, cliffs, peat, and stream banks close to the sea. It often forms dense colonies under coastal forest and in Veronica elliptica , Brachyglottis rotundifolia or Olearia scrub. In the subantarctic it grows in Poa litorosa tussock, Dracophyllum scrub and Bulbinella herbfield. It is frequently associated with Blechnum banksii , Asplenium obtusatum and A. scleroprium . Recognition: Blechnum durum is distinguished by its dimorphic fronds, free veins, pinnatisect sterile laminae, and continuous sori. It is confined to coastal habitats in the far south of the South Island, Stewart Island, and from the Chatham Islands to the subantarctic. It has fleshy fronds, and sterile laminae with narrowly triangular to oblong pinnae that are acute to obtuse at their apices, entire or slightly crenate on their margins, and adnate at their bases. The basal pinnae are arranged alternately. The laminae are glabrous and darker green on their adaxial surfaces, and the fertile fronds are only slightly shorter than the sterile fronds. Blechnum durum is likely to be confused only with B. banksii , which also occurs in coastal habitats. The former can be distinguished by its larger sterile laminae (140–700 mm long, 25–125 mm wide, cf. 30–440 mm long, 5–40 mm wide), fertile fronds that are only slightly shorter than the sterile, more crowded fertile pinnae, and scales on the rhizome and lower stipe that have black margins.

Blechnum filiforme (A.Cunn.),170-610mm-long; 2m,35-380mm-long,"Blechnum filiforme is a high-climbing fern found in podocarp and broadleaved forest, or more rarely in beech forest, coastal scrub and under mānuka or kānuka. It grows on river terraces, hillsides, banks, and in gullies. Juvenile plants are found creeping on the ground and over rocks and logs, before climbing a variety of forest trees and tree ferns. Recognition: Blechnum filiforme is readily distinguished by its long-creeping and climbing rhizomes, its trimorphic fronds, its free veins, and continuous sori. It is one of the few high-climbing ferns in New Zealand, and the country’s only climbing species of Blechnum . It initially creeps in tangled masses on the ground and over rock before growing up a tree trunk. The juvenile fronds produced on the ground are short, linear and have stalked, deeply serrate, obtuse pinnae. As the plant climbs, larger adult fronds are produced, with elongated and acuminate pinnae. Fertile fronds are usually produced c. 2 m above ground level, with long, very narrow pinnae. The fertile fronds are generally shorter and wider than the adult sterile fronds. Eventually the fern may completely smother the trunk of the host tree. Cytology: 2n = c. 66 (Chambers 1954). Notes: Lomariopsis hugelii was described by Presl (1851) from a specimen collected by Hügel in New Zealand. Although Brownlie (1959) examined a specimen at K and identified it as Blechnum filiforme , Presl’s protologue specifically cited a specimen “in Herb. Mus. pal. vind.”. The specimen in W (078561) is therefore the holotype, and the specimen in K seen by Brownlie is probably an isotype, although it has not been seen by us. Holttum (1968) also saw a duplicate in the Presl Herbarium at PRC but confirmed that the holotype is the specimen in W. The name Blechnum reptans was published by Luerssen (1871), apparently based on the unpublished name Osmunda reptans used by Solander and cited by Forster (1786, p. 93) as a nomen nudum. However, Luerssen also noted that “According to Brackenridge’s observations, the rhizome climbs up to a height of 20–30 feet on the trees”. This is an adequate description to validate B. reptans Luerss. as a new name. Nevertheless, the names Lomaria filiformis , Blechnum filiforme , Lomaria propinqua , L. pimpinellifolia , Stenochlaena heteromorpha and S. feejeensis Brack. were all cited in synonymy, and Blechnum reptans is therefore an illegitimate and superfluous name including two different taxa from New Zealand and Fiji. Luerssen cited a specimen collected by Brackenridge in Fiji, but also included New Zealand in the distribution. Christensen (1905–1906) treated B. reptans as a synonym of B. filiforme , but it is better regarded as an illegitimate name for a species of Stenochlaena in Fiji. 24Fig. 49 : Blechnum filiforme .

Blechnum fluviatile (R.Br.),80-760mm-long,,"Blechnum fluviatile is a terrestrial fern found in kauri, podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, under mānuka and kānuka, and sometimes under Pinus and Salix . It grows in damp, shaded areas on the forest floor, on stream banks and river terraces, in gullies and ditches, near waterfalls, on tracksides, hillsides and roadside banks, in damp grassland, on lake and swamp margins, and on coastal banks. Recognition: Blechnum fluviatile is distinguished by its dimorphic fronds, free veins, and sterile laminae that are pinnatisect distally and pinnate proximally. It has a rosette of drooping or prostrate sterile fronds with the fertile fronds held stiffly upright in the centre. The densely scaly stipes and rachises, the narrow sterile fronds with 8–65 pairs of pinnae with obtuse or rounded apices, and the fertile pinnae arising at a narrow angle to the rachis are also characteristic. One form is known with a normal-looking crown of fronds but with stolons growing from the rhizome (WELT P021208). DNA sequences from the form were identical to plants lacking stolons (Perrie unpub.). Further investigation is needed to determine the extent of stolon formation in B. fluviatile. Aberrant forms dividing repeatedly at the apex are occasionally found. 27Cytology: n = 68 (Brownlie 1954), 2n = 66, 132 (Chambers 1954, 1955). These counts represent diploid and tetraploid populations in New Zealand, but in Australia diploid, triploid, hexaploid and a possible pentaploid count have also been reported (Quinn 1961; Tindale & Roy 2002). Notes: Lomaria fluviatilis var. cristata West, cited by Chambers & Farrant (2001), is a nomen nudum because the epithet “var. cristata ” was never used in the original newspaper article (Anonymous 1879 26 April).The type of L. fluviatilis var. multifida T.Moore, said to have been based on the same plant, may have been lost. Apparently 3200 non-British specimens from Thomas Moore’s fern herbarium were given to B in 1888 (Stafleu & Cowan 1981), and may have later been destroyed during World War II. Chambers & Farrant (2001) regarded it as a minor mutant of Blechnum fluviatile. Fig. 60 : Blechnum fluviatile .

Blechnum fraseri (A.Cunn.),30-100mm-long; 8-24mm-wide,,"Blechnum fraseri is a terrestrial fern found in kauri, podocarp and broadleaved forest, under mānuka and kānuka, and, in the South Island, in beech forest. It favours dry, clay soils, often covering extensive areas of the forest floor. Recognition: Blechnum fraseri is a very distinct member of the genus in New Zealand. The rhizome is erect and forms a slender, woody trunk up to at least 1500 mm tall; the fronds are only slightly dimorphic, and bipinnatifid, unlike those of all other species, which are pinnatisect or pinnate. The fertile fronds are usually slightly smaller than the sterile fronds, with shorter, narrower pinnae. Aberrant forms with crested ends to the pinnae are occasionally found. Cytology: 2n = 56 (Murray & de Lange 2013). Notes: Allan (1961) stated “Type: K, 1825, C. Fraser ”. However, there is no sheet at K that corresponds to this citation. There are sheets annotated “ C. Fraser , no date”, “ C. Fraser , 1826” and “R. Cunningham , 1834”. Allan’s statement is therefore incorrect and cannot be taken as a lectotypification. The lectotype was designated as the sheet annotated “ C. Fraser , no date” by Chambers & Farrant (2001). Fig. 67 : Blechnum fraseri . Sterile bipinnatifid frond.Fig. 68 : Blechnum fraseri .

"Blechnum kermadecense Perrie & Brownsey in Perrie et al., Taxon 63: 754 (2014)",,310-770mm-long,"Blechnum kermadecense is a terrestrial fern, occurring in dry Metrosideros kermadecensis forest, in clearings, on tracksides, on banks, among scoria and boulders, and in more open areas. It is rare in the wetter forest. Recognition: Blechnum kermadecense , previously included in the genus Doodia , is recognised by its monomorphic fronds, anastomosing veins, and discrete rather than continuous sori arranged in two rows parallel to the pinna costae. It is distinguished from B. molle and B. zeelandicum by its pinnae, which are mostly adnate, and stalked only in the lower third of the rachis. It is most similar to B. parrisiae , which also occurs on the Kermadec Islands. Blechnum kermadecense has generally longer and more membranous pinnae (44–140 mm long, cf. 5–80mm long), is glabrous or only sparsely hairy on the rachises and laminae, and has young fronds that are never tinged pink. It is also said to have fronds of pale grassy- green colour (Parris 1972). Cytology: 2n = c. 160 (de Lange et al. 2004). Notes: This species was misidentified as Doodia connexa Kunze in some earlier New Zealand Floras. It was recognised as Doodia media var. milnei by Allan (1961), but raised to species rank by Parris (1972). When treated in Blechnum it requires the new name, B. kermadecense (Perrie et al. 2014). 32Fig. 76 : Blechnum kermadecense .

Blechnum membranaceum (Colenso ex Hook.),50-360mm-long,,"Blechnum membranaceum is a terrestrial fern found in podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, under mānuka and kānuka, and in coastal scrub. It grows on clay banks, on stream banks and river flats, on rocks, on cliffs and rocky bluffs, in gullies, and on the ground, usually in more open forest. It is often found on limestone rock and around sinkholes. Recognition: Blechnum membranaceum is distinguished by its dimorphic fronds, free veins, pinnatisect, sterile laminae, and continuous sori. The sterile laminae are linear to narrowly obovate, with oblong to orbicular pinnae that are rounded to obtuse at their apices, dentate on the margins, and adnate at their bases. The basal pinnae are usually arranged in opposite pairs. The laminae are glabrous and a similar colour on both surfaces. The sterile fronds form a prostrate to suberect rosette with the fertile fronds held upright in the centre, the fertile usually longer than the sterile. Blechnum membranaceum is very similar to B. chambersii , the two species hybridising in areas of overlap, but plants of B. membranaceum can be recognised by their generally narrower sterile laminae (8–40 mm wide, cf. 15–115 mm wide); obovate rather than elliptic outline; more obviously toothed pinnae, which are arranged in opposite pairs rather than alternately at the base of the lamina; and their fertile fronds, which are longer, not shorter, than the sterile fronds. Cytology: 2n = 66 (Chambers 1954). Hybridisation: There is evidence for hybridisation between Blechnum membranaceum and B. chambersii (see Blechnum ×aggregatum ; Tindale 1960). Notes: DNA sequences for a single chloroplast locus from Blechnum chambersii and B. membranaceum were identical or differed by one base pair (Shepherd et al. 2007). Wilson (2012), using DNA sequences from three chloroplast loci, found samples of B. membranaceum , B. norfolkianum from New Zealand, and Australian and New Zealand B. chambersii to differ by up to seven base pairs, but with no strongly supported relationships among them. The two studies indicate that all three taxa are very closely related. In the absence of a type specimen, the synonymy of Lomaria pygmaea with B. membranaceum is based on historical precedent first determined by Cheeseman (1906), which is at least partly consistent with the protologue. 35Fig. 80 : Blechnum membranaceum .

Blechnum minus (R.Br.),100-1700mm-long; 50mm,,"Blechnum minus is a terrestrial fern found in podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, under mānuka and kānuka, in scrub, under willows, and in open areas. It grows in swamps and bogs, on the margins of swamps and lakes, in ditches, in impeded streams, on peat, in damp hollows, on stabilised dunes, on wet ground, and on river banks and flood plains, often amongst Phormium , raupō, and sedges. Recognition: The swamp kiokio is very closely related to B. novae-zelandiae . It is distinguished by its slender and rather spindly form. In contrast to B. novae-zelandiae , the rhizome is often erect, the sterile laminae are much smaller (80–1000 mm long, 20–310 mm wide; cf. 150–2125 mm long, 65–740 wide), the sterile pinnae much narrower (6–18 mm wide, cf. 9–30 mm wide) and more widely spaced, and the number of pinna pairs fewer (3–27, cf. 7–53). The stipe scales and abaxial costa scales are concolorous, lacking the characteristic “black spot” of B. novae-zelandiae . The fertile pinnae have less pronounced proximal sterile flanges, and there are only 1–4 pairs of sterile lobes at the base of the fertile laminae compared to 2–9 in B. novae-zelandiae . It is further distinguished by growing in swamp or poorly drained habitats, in contrast to B. novae-zelandiae , which characteristically grows on banks, road cuttings, cliffs and rock faces, and along tracks and streambanks, as well as occupying swampy habitats. Cytology: n = 28 (Brownlie 1954 – as B. procerum ); 2n = 56 (Murray & de Lange 2013). Brownlie’s count of n = 28 was listed by Dawson et al. (2000) under B. novae-zelandiae , but the voucher specimen (CHR 396424) is a plant of B. minus from Lake Mahinapua, Westland. Hybridisation: It is likely that Blechnum minus and B. novae-zelandiae hybridise in swampy areas, where the two species often occur together (e.g. CHR 145524). Blechnum minus may also hybridise occasionally with B. procerum (e.g. WELT P029462). Notes: This plant has been variously referred to as the swamp kiokio (Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth 1989, 2000) or the swamp form of Blechnum novae-zelandiae (Chambers & Farrant 1998b). It was first recognised in New Zealand by Colenso (1893), who collected it from the margin of a low wood, on the edge of the great plain south of Dannevirke, and described it as Lomaria procera var. gracilis. Colenso’s description, and the type specimen (K 001092716), leave no doubt that it is the same as those identified later as the swamp form or swamp kiokio. Chambers & Farrant (1998b) did not fully resolve the identity of this entity, but they referred to it as the swamp form of Blechnum novae-zelandiae , and included Colenso’s Lomaria procera var. gracilis in synonymy. They described plants as spindly with well-spaced pinnae, poorly developed auricles, and the rhizome tending to form a small, vertical trunk. However, Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth (1989, 2000) had earlier referred such plants to the Australian species B. minus (R.Br.) Ettingsh. on the basis of their concolorous scales, rather than scales with conspicuous black centres characteristic of B. novae-zelandiae . Although Chambers & Farrant (1998b) accepted that New Zealand and Australian material shared concolorous scales, they noted that “unlike B. minus some swamp kiokio plants have scales tending towards ‘black-spot’”. They concluded that “the swamp form is not identical with the Australian B. minus , otherwise it would be expected to be more widespread in New Zealand in habitats other than swamps”. 38DNA sequence data has not helped in resolving these relationships. It merely confirms that the three entities are very closely related (Perrie et al. 2014). More sophisticated analysis is required to provide better resolution. In the meantime, we prefer to ally the New Zealand swamp form with the Australian B. minus , rather than with the New Zealand B. novae-zelandiae . The most convincing character that distinguishes the swamp form is the presence of concolorous scales on the costae, rachises and stipes. These are identical to those in B. minus , and quite different to the “black-spot” scales of B. novae-zelandiae . It is likely that those plants identified by Chambers & Farrant as having scales tending towards “black-spot” are actually hybrids, occurring in places where the two taxa occur together. The relatively small and spindly forms of the swamp form in New Zealand are very similar to small plants of B. minus in Australia, and indeed to the type material first collected by Robert Brown (BM 001048221, BM 00093974). However, it has to be acknowledged that the plant does not grow as large in New Zealand as it does in Australia, nor occupy such a wide range of habitats. This may be because those habitats are already occupied by B. novae-zelandiae , and that it is only in swampy habitats that B. minus can compete and survive. An alternative possibility is that the swamp form is actually a third species. However, on present evidence there are insufficient characters to distinguish it from both B. minus and B. novae-zelandiae . Further investigation is required to confirm the status of the plants, which are treated here as belonging to B. minus. Fig. 89 : Blechnum minus .

Blechnum molle (Parris),110-620mm-long,,"Blechnum molle is a terrestrial fern found in podocarp and broadleaved forest, under kānuka, in open scrub, and in coastal bush. It grows on stream banks, near waterfalls, at the base of tree trunks, on clay banks and rocky bluffs, in humus hummocks on the forest floor, under overhangs, and among damp rocks. Recognition: Blechnum molle , previously included in the genus Doodia , is recognised by its weakly dimorphic fronds, young fronds which are tinged pink, and anastomosing venation. It is distinguished from B. kermadecense , B. neohollandicum and B. parrisiae by its pinnae, which are adnate only in the upper third of the rachis. It is most similar to B. zeelandicum , from which it is distinguished by its much shorter terminal pinna segment, and by the presence of hairs on the rachis. It is further distinguished by its characteristic fertile pinnae, which bear basal basiscopic and acroscopic lobes, rather than just acroscopic lobes, and by its hexaploid rather than tetraploid chromosome number.  Blechnum molle is closely related to B. spinulosum Poir., which is endemic to Australia, but distinguished by its shorter terminal pinna, larger auricles, and fewer pairs of pinnae (Parris 1980). Chromosome numbers of n = 64 and n = c. 120 have been reported in Australia, in contrast to n = c. 96 in New Zealand (Tindale & Roy 2002). Aberrant forms are known with the basal pair of primary pinnae greatly extended and divided into multiple secondary pinnae. Cytology: n = c. 96 (Brownlie 1961 – as Doodia caudata ). Hybridisation: There is evidence for hybridisation between Blechnum molle and B. parrisiae (see Blechnum ×digenum ; Parris 1972). Notes: This species has been widely misidentified in most earlier New Zealand Floras as Doodia caudata (Cav.) R.Br., now treated as Blechnum spinulosum Poir. It was recognised as the New Zealand endemic D. molle , distinct from Doodia caudata , by Parris (1980), and later transferred to Blechnum by Christenhusz et al. (2011). 41Fig. 98 : Blechnum molle .

"Blechnum montanum T.C.Chambers & P.A.Farrant, New Zealand J. Bot. 36: 11 (1998)",200-1150mm-long; 185-970mm-long,,"Blechnum montanum is a terrestrial fern found in podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, under mānuka and kānuka, in pine forest, in subalpine scrub and herbfield, and in tussock grassland. It grows in rocky gorges, on cliffs, amongst rocks, on rock outcrops, on roadbanks and cuttings, on 43stream banks, near waterfalls, amongst tussock, and in fernland and peat bog. In the subantarctic it grows under Metrosideros forest, Dracophyllum scrub and among megaherbs. Recognition: Blechnum montanum is recognised by its dimorphic fronds, free veins, pinnate sterile laminae, and continuous sori. The sterile laminae are elliptic to ovate, divided into falcate pinnae with acute to acuminate apices and short-stalked bases. The basal pinnae are opposite, and only the basal pair are sometimes reduced in size, and then only slightly. The laminae bear a mixture of chestnut- brown concolorous scales and bicolorous scales with a conspicuous dark spot around the point of attachment. Both surfaces are of similar colour, and the fertile fronds are equal to, or a little shorter than, the sterile fronds. Plants from the subantarctic have slightly wider pinnae on the sterile fronds. Blechnum montanum is similar to four other closely related species with stalked, sterile pinnae. It is distinguished by its basal pinnae, which are scarcely reduced in size and rarely less than half the length of those at mid-lamina, unlike those in B. minus and B. novae-zelandiae , which are many times shorter at the base than at mid-lamina. The pinnae are falcate, taper to acute or acuminate apices, and are arranged in 5–27 pairs, unlike those in B. procerum , which are straight, have obtuse or rounded apices, and are arranged in 1–12 pairs. B. montanum is most similar to B. triangularifolium but distinguished by its narrower, sterile laminae (60–280 mm wide, cf. 90–560 mm wide), smaller number of sterile pinna pairs (5–27, cf. 6–32), and bronze or olive-green rather than pale green fronds. B. montanum is a montane or subalpine species found more frequently in the South Island, whereas B. triangularifolium ​​​​​​​is a lowland species. Cytology: 2n = 56 (Chambers 1954; Chambers & Farrant 1998b). Hybridisation: Blechnum montanum is thought to hybridise with B. novae-zelandiae (e.g. AK 203698, Lake Rotoiti; CHR 323665, Waipawa R., Ruahine Ranges), the distributions of the two species often overlapping in montane habitats (Chambers & Farrant 1998b). Hybrids between B. montanum and B. procerum (e.g. AK 174551, Tangihua Forest, Northland; AK 44043, Mt Troup, Doubtful Sound; CHR 260060, Otokoro Stream, Kaimanawa Range) have also been reported by Chambers & Farrant (1998b).

Blechnum nigrum (Colenso),60-310mm-long; 6-45mm-long; 1-2mm-wide,,"Blechnum nigrum is a terrestrial fern found in podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest. It grows on stream banks, in gullies, on damp rock faces and banks, between boulders, under tree roots, and on the ground in dark, wet forest. Recognition: Blechnum nigrum is a very distinctive species recognised by its strongly dimorphic fronds, free veins, pinnatisect sterile laminae, and continuous sori. It has dark green fronds and sterile laminae with an enlarged terminal pinna. The lateral pinnae decrease in size down the frond except for the enlarged basal pair, which are often as wide as the terminal pinna. The stipes, rachises, abaxial surfaces of the laminae, and margins of the pinnae are covered in short, stiff, red-brown hairs. The pinnae are adnate to the rachis, irregularly dentate on their margins, and rounded at the apices. The fertile fronds are the same size as, or slightly longer than, the sterile fronds. The species grows prostrate in dark, wet forest habitats and is often covered in epiphyllous bryophytes. Cytology: 2n = 66 (Chambers 1954). 48Fig. 117 : Blechnum nigrum .

Blechnum norfolkianum (Heward),230-550mm-long; 200mm-long,,"Blechnum norfolkianum is found in kauri forest, coastal broadleaved forest, and under coastal scrub, growing on cliffs, clay banks, in rock crevices, on streamsides, in gullies, or on the forest floor. Recognition: Blechnum norfolkianum is distinguished by its dimorphic fronds, free veins, pinnatisect sterile laminae, and continuous sori. The sterile laminae are narrowly elliptic to narrowly obovate, with narrowly oblong pinnae that are acuminate at their apices, shallowly crenate on the margins, and 50adnate at their bases. The basal pinnae are alternate. The laminae are glabrous, of similar colours on both surfaces, and are never tinged red. The sterile fronds surround the fertile fronds, which are held upright in the centre, the fertile usually a little shorter than the sterile. B. norfolkianum is very similar to B. chambersii , differing principally in its larger fronds, wider laminae, shiny green colour, more acuminate pinna apices, and oblong basal flanges. In B. chambersii the sterile laminae are 15–115 mm wide and the longest pinnae 14–60 mm long, compared to 70–250 mm wide and 50–125 mm long in B. norfolkianum . The fertile laminae are 10–70 mm wide, and the longest pinnae 5–40 mm long in B. chambersii , and 50–190 mm wide and 25–100 mm long in B. norfolkianum. The lamina length:width ratio is c. 3–5:1 in sterile fronds and c. 2–5:1 in fertile fronds of B. norfolkianum , compared to ratios of c. 4–6.5:1 and c. 5–10:1, respectively, in B. chambersii . Occasional aberrant forms are found with mixed fertile and sterile pinnae on the same frond. Cytology: 2n = c. 66 (Chambers 1954). Hybridisation: It is likely that Blechnum norfolkianum hybridises with B. chambersii on offshore islands where the two species frequently occur together, and where the two species are sometimes hard to distinguish (see Chambers & Farrant 1998a). However, no sign of spore abortion has been seen in plants of intermediate morphology, and conclusive evidence of hybridisation is lacking. Notes: In some earlier New Zealand Floras this species was misidentified as Lomaria attenuata (Sw.) Willd. Green (1994) included Samoa and the Society Islands in the distribution of this species, probably on the basis of misidentifications. The occurrence of this species outside New Zealand and Norfolk Island needs confirmation. DNA sequences from Blechnum chambersii and B. norfolkianum are identical (Shepherd et al. 2007), indicating that they are very closely related. Further work is needed to establish the genetic evidence for their distinctiveness. Fig. 124 : Blechnum norfolkianum .

"Blechnum novae-zelandiae T.C.Chambers & P.A.Farrant, New Zealand J. Bot. 36: 8 (1998)",,3000mm-long,"Blechnum novae-zelandiae is a widespread terrestrial fern found in kauri, podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, under mānuka and kānuka, in scrub and clearings, on forest margins, in Pinus radiata forest, under Salix species, in Carex swamp, in tussock, and in rough pasture. It grows on forest margins, on roadside banks and cuttings, on cliffs and rock faces, on slips, on stream and river banks, in gullies, on tracksides and overhanging banks, on pākihi soils, in ditches, along swampy creeks, on lake margins, and in wetlands, swamps, bogs and dune hollows. Recognition: Blechnum novae-zelandiae is recognised by its dimorphic fronds, free veins, pinnate sterile laminae, and continuous sori. It is extremely variable in size, with fronds ranging from about 200 mm to 3 m long. The sterile laminae are elliptic to obovate, divided into usually straight pinnae with acuminate apices and short-stalked bases. The basal pinnae are opposite, and several proximal pairs are greatly reduced to small, rounded lobes. The abaxial pinna costae bear many bicolorous 53scales with a conspicuous dark spot confined to the proximal half of the scale, but the black spot decreases in size on scales at the pinna apices and on the distal pinnae, with the scales becoming concolorous. Both lamina surfaces are of similar colour. The fertile fronds are equal to or shorter than the sterile, have pinnae with short, sterile flanges proximally, and 2–9 pairs of short, rounded, sterile lobes at the base of the lamina. Blechnum novae-zelandiae is similar to four other closely related species with stalked sterile pinnae. It is distinguished by its basal pinnae, which are markedly reduced to small, rounded lobes, unlike those in B. montanum , B. procerum and B. triangularifolium , which are rarely less than half the length of those at mid-lamina. The larger frond size, greater number of pinna pairs, and presence of sterile flanges at the base of the fertile pinnae will also distinguish B. novae-zelandiae from the other three. Blechnum novae-zelandiae is most similar to B. minus , from which it is distinguished by its stipe and costa scales, which have a prominent dark spot around the point of attachment, unlike those in B. minus , which are concolorous. B. minus is distinguished from B. novae-zelandiae , by being a rather spindly form, characteristically found in swampy areas or alongside streams (discussed under B. minus ). Cytology: 2n = 56 (Chambers 1954; Chambers & Farrant 1998b). Dawson et al. (2000) list a count of n = 28 by Brownlie (1954 – as B. procerum ) for B. novae-zelandiae , but the voucher specimen (CHR 396424) is a plant of B. minus from Lake Mahinapua, Westland. Hybridisation: There is good evidence for hybridisation between diploid Blechnum novae-zelandiae and tetraploid B. procerum , triploid hybrids with 2n = 112 having been recorded by Chambers & Farrant (1998b). Spores in hybrid plants are aborted. B. novae-zelandiae is also thought to hybridise with B. montanum (e.g. AK 203698, Lake Rotoiti), the distributions of the two species often overlapping in montane habitats (Chambers & Farrant 1998b). It is also likely that B. novae-zealandiae hybridises with B. minus in swampy areas where the two species occur together. Notes: This species was widely misidentified as Lomaria capensis (L.) Willd. or Blechnum capense (L.) Schltdl. in earlier New Zealand Floras. Domin (1913) used the name Blechnum capense var. auriculatum for the plant listed as Lomaria procera var. β by Hooker (1854–1855). Chambers & Farrant (1998b) included Hooker’s var. β in the synonymy of Blechnum novae-zelandiae , and that is where this name probably belongs. However, no original material was cited, and none has been located in either Hooker’s herbarium at K, or in Domin’s herbarium at PR. Hence the true identity of the name remains uncertain. Chambers & Farrant (1998b) noted a distinctive form of B. novae-zelandiae on the Chatham Islands with leafy auricles at the base of the sterile fronds, several sterile auricles at the base of the fertile fronds, and bilobed auriculate bases to each fertile pinna. This form was not recognised as a distinct taxon by de Lange et al. (2011) and is not given any taxonomic status here. Blechnum aff. novae-zelandiae from the Kermadec Islands is said to have uniformly green fronds lacking red colour when fresh, and sometimes lacks black spots in the stipe and rachis scales (de Lange 2020). It is not recognised here as a distinct taxon, but may warrant further investigation. 54Fig. 131 : Blechnum novae-zelandiae .

"Blechnum parrisiae Christenh. in Christenhusz et al., Phytotaxa 19: 20 (2011)",,130-760mm-long,"Blechnum parrisiae is a terrestrial fern found in podocarp, coastal pōhutukawa and other broadleaved forest, under mānuka and kānuka, in coastal scrub, under pine and macrocarpa forest, in clearings, on forest margins, and in bush remnants and wooded urban environments. It grows along rocky streambeds, on alluvial flats, among boulders and scoria, on roadside banks and cuttings, on coastal cliffs, on open clay banks, in rough pasture, and on grassy hillsides in full sun. Recognition: Blechnum parrisiae , previously included in the genus Doodia , is recognised by its monomorphic fronds, young fronds that are tinged pink, anastomosing venation, and discrete rather than continuous sori arranged parallel to the pinna costae. It is distinguished from B. molle and B. zeelandicum by its pinnae, which are mostly adnate and stalked only in the lower third of the rachis. 57It is most similar to B. neohollandicum , which is very rare and probably no longer extant in New Zealand, and B. kermadecense , which is confined to the Kermadec Islands. In B. neohollandicum all pinnae, except sometimes the basal pair, are adnate to the rachis, and all have tubercles along the rachis and costae, which are absent in B. parrisiae . B. kermadecense has generally longer and more membranous pinnae (44–140 mm long, cf. 5–80 mm long), is only sparsely hairy on the rachises and laminae, and has young fronds which are never tinged pink. Aberrant forms with forking of the rachis are known. Cytology: n = 64 (Brownlie 1961– as Doodia media ). A count of 2n = 64 has been reported from Australia (Tindale & Roy 2002), suggesting a possible difference between trans-Tasman populations. Hybridisation: There is evidence for hybridisation between Blechnum parrisiae and B. molle (see Blechnum ×digenum ; Parris 1972), B. neohollandicum (see under that species), and possibly B. zeelandicum (AK 297573, Macauley Island). Notes: This species was misidentified as Doodia kunthiana Gaudich. in some early New Zealand Floras. It was treated as Doodia media by Allan (1961) and as D. media subsp. australis by Parris (1972), and raised to species rank as D. australis by Parris (1998). When treated in Blechnum , it requires the new name B. parrisiae (Christenhusz et al. 2011). The name Doodia aucklandica Field (1906) was treated as a nomen nudum by Parris (1972) under Blechnum parrisiae (as Doodia media subsp. australis ). Fig. 142 : Blechnum parrisiae .

Blechnum penna-marina subsp. alpina (R.Br.),35-430mm-long,,"Blechnum penna-marina subsp. alpina is a terrestrial fern found in podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, under mānuka and Salix species, in pine forest, in Sphagnum bog and wet pasture, and in subalpine scrub, tussock grassland and rocky herbfield. It grows on creek banks and in creek beds, on river terraces, at forest margins, along tracksides and roadsides, on clay banks, among rocks and scree, in dune hollows and coastal turf, in swamps and on peaty soils, and in subalpine habitats. Recognition: Blechnum penna-marina subsp. alpina is characterised by its dimorphic fronds, free veins, pinnatisect sterile laminae, and continuous sori. It has a creeping rhizome, and sterile laminae that are linear to narrowly elliptic, bearing oblong or triangular pinnae with entire or shallowly dentate margins. The basal pinnae are usually opposite. The fertile fronds are up to twice as long as the sterile. The general shape and dimensions of the laminae in B. penna-marina subsp. alpina are similar to those of B. banksii and B. membranaceum , but B. penna-marina is distinguished by its creeping rhizome and much longer fertile fronds. Cytology: n = 34 (Brownlie 1954), 2n = 66 (Chambers 1954; Chambers & Farrant 1996b). Notes: Jeßen & Lehmann (2018) attempted to make the new combination Austroblechnum penna- marina subsp. alpina but incorrectly cited the basionym of the subspecific epithet as Chambers & Farrant (1996b), rather than Brown (1810). They also failed to provide the date and place of publication of Brown’s basionym, and hence their combination was not validly made. The combination was correctly made by Field (2020). 62Fig. 154 : Blechnum penna-marina subsp. alpina .

Blechnum procerum (G.Forst.),1430mm-long,,"Blechnum procerum is a terrestrial fern found in open kauri, podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, under mānuka and kānuka, in scrub, among Phormium , under introduced conifers, and in subalpine scrub and tussock grassland. It grows on the forest floor, on streambanks, in gullies, along tracksides, at forest margins, in open rocky areas, on roadside banks and cuttings, in ditches, on swampy ground, on pākihi soils, and in rough pasture. Recognition: Blechnum procerum is recognised by its dimorphic fronds, free veins, stalked sterile pinnae, and continuous sori. The sterile laminae are elliptic to ovate, divided into straight pinnae with obtuse to acute apices and short-stalked bases. The basal pinnae are opposite, and usually not reduced much in size. The laminae bear dark bicolorous scales with pale margins, which occur on the rachises and abaxial pinna costae, sometimes becoming chestnut-brown and concolorous towards the pinna apices. The bicolorous scales have ill-defined dark areas and pale margins, but lack an obvious dark spot. Both lamina surfaces are similar in colour, and the fertile fronds are longer than the sterile. Blechnum procerum is similar to four other closely related species with stalked sterile pinnae. It is distinguished by its basal pinnae, which are usually scarcely reduced in size, unlike those in B. minus and B. novae-zelandiae , which are many times shorter at the base than at mid-lamina. The basal fertile pinnae in B. procerum are also scarcely reduced in size and do not have basal sterile flanges. The sterile pinnae are straight, have obtuse or acute apices, and are arranged in 1–12 pairs, unlike those in B. triangularifolium , which are falcate, taper to long caudate apices, and are arranged in 6–32 pairs. B. procerum is most similar to B. montanum but is distinguished by its smaller number of sterile pinna pairs (1–12, cf. 5–27), and sterile pinnae, which are broader (10–35 mm wide, cf. 17–24 mm wide), straight rather than falcate, and have obtuse or acute rather than acuminate apices. The fertile fronds are usually much longer than the sterile fronds, whereas in B. montanum they are about equal in length. B. procerum can also be distinguished from B. montanum and B. triangularifolium by its scales with ill-defined dark areas and pale margins, unlike the other two species, which have scales with clearly defined dark spots. Cytology: 2n = 112 (Chambers 1954 – as B. minor ; Chambers & Farrant 1998b). Hybridisation: There is good evidence for hybridisation between tetraploid Blechnum procerum and diploid B. novae-zelandiae , triploid hybrids with 2n = 112 having been recorded by Chambers & Farrant (1998b). Spores in hybrid plants are aborted. Hybrids between B. procerum and B. montanum (e.g. AK 174551, Tangihua Forest, Northland) have also been reported by Chambers & Farrant (1998b). Blechnum procerum may also occasionally hybridise with B. minus (e.g. WELT P029462, Charming Creek, Western Nelson). Notes: This species was misidentified as Blechnum minus (R.Br.) Ettingsh. by both Allan (1961) and Crookes (1963). 65Chambers & Farrant (1998b) selected K 001092705 as the lectotype of Osmunda procera G.Forst. without any reference to the earlier designation by Tindale (1960). This is contrary to Art. 9.19, which states that the author who first designates a lectotype in conformity with Art. 9.11–9.13 must be followed. Chambers & Farrant (1998b) cited a specimen collected by Potts from the Malvern Hills (K 001092715) as the holotype of Lomaria duplicata Potts. However, there is also a specimen in the Armstrong Herbarium (CHR 633349) collected by Potts from the Malvern Hills, which appears to be a duplicate, and which was not seen by Chambers & Farrant. Their citation of the specimen in K is therefore an inadvertent lectotypification. Domin (1913) used the name Blechnum capense var. hookerianum for the plant listed as Lomaria procera var. α by Hooker (1854–1855), although Domin erroneously cited it as “ Lomaria capensis var. α”. Hooker’s var. α would have been the variety that included the type of Forster’s original species, Osmunda procera , and hence Domin’s Blechnum capense var. hookerianum is listed here as a homotypic synonym. Chambers & Farrant (1998b) also included Hooker’s var. α as a synonym of Blechnum procerum. Domin (1913) used the name Blechnum capense var. contractum for the plant listed as Lomaria procera var. γ by Hooker (1854–1855). Chambers & Farrant (1998b) included Hooker’s var. γ in the synonymy of Blechnum procerum , and that is where this name probably belongs. However, no original material was cited, and none has been located in either Hooker’s herbarium at K, or in Domin’s herbarium at PR. Hence the true identity of the name remains uncertain.

It grows on dry slopes, road and river banks, cliffs, rock walls and overhanging rock, in coastal seepages, and in dune slacks. It favours sandstone, mudstone, siltstone, rhyolite, limestone, and calcareous soils. Recognition: Blechnum triangularifolium is recognised by its dimorphic fronds, free veins, pinnate sterile laminae, and continuous sori. The sterile laminae are elliptic to ovate, divided into falcate pinnae with caudate apices and short-stalked bases. The basal pinnae are opposite or alternate, and 69not reduced in size. The laminae bear dark, shiny, bicolorous scales on the rachises and pinna costae that have well-defined dark areas and pale margins. The adaxial surfaces are slightly darker green than the abaxial ones, and the fertile fronds are usually a little shorter than the sterile fronds. Blechnum triangularifolium is similar to four other closely related species with stalked sterile pinnae. It is distinguished by its basal pinnae, which are scarcely reduced in size and rarely less than half the length of those at mid-lamina, unlike those in B. minus and B. novae-zelandiae , which are many times shorter at the base than at mid-lamina.

"Blechnum zeelandicum Christenh. in Christenhusz et al., Phytotaxa 19: 20 (2011)",110-530mm-long,,"Blechnum zeelandicum is a terrestrial fern found in podocarp and broadleaved forest, and under mānuka and kānuka, in scrub, and on coastal slopes. It grows on stream banks and river terraces, near waterfalls, under shaded overhangs, among rocks, in rock crevices, on road and clay banks, at the base of cliffs, on fallen logs, and near geothermal streams. Recognition: Blechnum zeelandicum , previously included in the genus Doodia , is recognised by its weakly dimorphic fronds, young fronds that are tinged pink, and anastomosing venation. It is distinguished from B. kermadecense , B. neohollandicum and B. parrisiae by its pinnae, which are adnate only in the distal half to ⅓ of the rachis. It is most similar to B. molle , from which it is distinguished by its generally much longer terminal pinna segment, its decurrent or adnate pinnae extending further down the rachis (almost to halfway in some cases), and its rachis, which lacks hairs. It is further distinguished by its fertile pinnae, which usually bear acroscopic auricles only, rather than acroscopic and basiscopic auricles or lobes, and by its tetraploid rather than hexaploid chromosome number. Cytology: 2n = 128 (de Lange et al. 2004). Hybridisation: Blechnum zeelandicum may hybridise with B. parrisiae (AK 297573, Macauley Island). Notes: This species was not recognised in New Zealand by Allan (1961), but was later accepted by Parris (1972) as Doodia squarrosa.

Etymology: From the Latin aggregatus (clustered together), a reference to the growth habit of the original collection, with several plants growing together from one root-stock. Biostatus: Indigenous (Endemic). Recognition: Blechnum ×aggregatum is the hybrid between B. chambersii and B. membranaceum , usually arising wherever the two species occur together, and characterised by its intermediate morphology. It is more easily recognised in the field than in the herbarium, possibly because the differences between the hybrid and its two parents are more obvious in live material. The fronds are of intermediate size and outline, but hybrid plants can sometimes be recognised by having relatively narrow, obovate sterile laminae, similar to those of B. membranaceum , but fertile fronds that are equal to or shorter than the sterile ones, like those in B. chambersii . Spores of both species have a very smooth perine (Large & Braggins 1991), and hybrid plants usually have spores of normal appearance. Only very rarely are malformed spores seen (e.g. WELT P001231, Pukeatua). Notes: Blechnum chambersii and B. membranaceum are morphologically and genetically very similar. They differ by only one base pair (Shepherd et al. 2007). It is quite possible that hybrids have some degree of inter-fertility, and that hybrid swarms may include F1 and back-cross hybrids, along with the parent species. This requires further investigation. Blechnum ×digenum (Parris) Brownsey & Perrie, New Zealand J. Bot. 57: 240 (2019) ≡ Doodia ×digena Parris, New Zealand J. Bot. 10: 596 (1972) Holotype: Kitekite Falls, Piha, Auckland, B.S. Parris , 26 May 1966, CHR 202054! Etymology: From the Latin digenus (of two kinds), a reference to the hybrid origin of this plant. Biostatus: Indigenous (Endemic). Recognition: Blechnum ×digenum is believed to be the hybrid between B. molle and B. parrisiae , usually arising wherever the two parent species occur together. It is recognised by its intermediate morphology. The fertile and sterile fronds are dimorphic, unlike those in B. parrisiae . The fronds are harsh, and the rachises bear scales, unlike those in B. molle . There are 22–30 pairs of pinnae, 74intermediate between the range of 11–21 in B. molle and 20–50 in B. parrisiae . The pinnae at mid- lamina are stalked, rather than sessile or adnate as in B. parrisiae . Spores in some hybrid plants (e.g. WELT P017873, Wairua Falls near Whangārei, and WELT P015771, Pukemokemoke) are of very irregular sizes (but not shrivelled and aborted); others appear normal, as reported by Parris (1972). Cytology: n = >30 univalents + >60 bivalents (Brownlie 1961– as intermediates between Doodia caudata and D. media ). The presence of bivalents and univalents strongly suggests that the spores would be sterile. 7",1-4mm-long,70-200mm-long; 15-50mm-wide; 8-30mm-long; 4-8mm-wide; 18-55mm-long; 80-385mm-long; 10-80mm-wide; 5-54mm-long; 1.5-6mm-wide; 10-170mm-long,,100mm,,,,85-430mm-long,25-140mm-long; 30-200mm-long,Blechnaceae,"['indigenous', 'endemic']"
Cyathea colensoi (Hook.f.),,460-1500mm-long,"Cyathea colensoi occurs most frequently under beech forest, but also under podocarp, Weinmannia , Metrosideros umbellata and Libocedrus forest, and occasionally on road cuttings or under scrub. Recognition: Cyathea colensoi is the only species of the genus in New Zealand that produces fertile fronds from a prostrate rhizome. Very rarely plants with a short trunk no more than 1 m high have been observed but these cases are exceptional. Cyathea colensoi is also the only native species that lacks an indusium. It has conspicuous hairs in the sorus which are longer than the sporangia. It is often mistaken in the field for young plants of C. smithii , but the latter species never produces fertile fronds until it has developed a trunk. Cytology: n = 69 (Brownlie 1958). Notes: There are two collections in the Hookers’ Herbarium at K, numbered 1673 and 1673α. Colenso’s collections were sent to W.J. Hooker in a letter dated 21 January 1848. In the letter, Colenso stated “1673. Polypodium ruahinensis , W.C., a beautiful species - never arborescent, fronds 4–5 feet long, woods, ascent to Ruahine, ½-way up. It has hairs under its sori, and had it been arborescent, I should have called it an Alsophila ”. The specimens themselves are labelled “Polypodium ruahinense ” (St George 2009). Colenso 1673 was chosen as the lectotype by Brownsey & Perrie (2015b). 5Fig. 2 : Cyathea colensoi . Mature plant lacking a trunk growing on the forest floor.Fig. 3 : Cyathea colensoi .

"Cyathea cunninghamii Hook.f. in Hooker, Icon. Pl. 10, t. 985 (1854)",,1500-3000mm-long,"Brownsey (1979) noted that Cyathea cunninghamii “…appears to favour damp gullies or river banks in lowland forested areas, particularly where there are fresh soils or there is frequent deposition of detritus and silt”. It is a tall, emergent species recorded from podocarp and broadleaved forest, kānuka forest, wetland forest, and occasionally from silver beech forest, or under Pinus radiata . It also occurs in coastal forest and sometimes with nikau in the South Island. It is susceptible to drought (Brownsey 1979) and is rare in the eastern parts of both main islands. It is locally common in damper areas of the North Island, such as along the Whanganui River. Recognition: On the main islands of New Zealand Cyathea cunninghamii is most easily confused with C. medullaris . It is distinguished by its slender trunk covered in appressed stipe bases rather than hexagonal scars, shorter (up to 3 m long cf. up to 5 m long) and rather lacy fronds, thinner and rougher stipes (up to 45 mm wide and 35 mm deep cf. up to 90 mm wide and 60 mm deep), stipe scales that lack marginal setae, and hood-shaped rather than irregularly splitting indusia. Cyathea cunninghamii differs from C. smithii in lacking a skirt of persistent dead fronds when mature, and having hood-shaped rather than saucer-shaped indusia. These three species can also be distinguished by the form of their lamina scales (Brownsey 1979). Cyathea cunninghamii is morphologically very similar to C. kermadecensis . The two taxa share indusia which open at maturity to form a hood-shape, and a diverse array of very similar hairs and scales on the abaxial surface of the laminae. No other taxa in New Zealand or Australia have indusia of this type or such a diversity of scales and hairs. However, C. kermadecensis has a greater abundance of large pale brown scales on the abaxial surfaces of the costae than C. cunninghamii , and scattered, irregularly curled, acicular hairs on the abaxial costae, which are usually absent in C. cunninghamii . C. kermadecensis also lacks the red acaroid scales of C. cunninghamii , producing only colourless acaroid scales with slightly longer branches. The tertiary pinnae of C. cunninghamii are slightly more divided, and the stipe bases of C. kermadecensis are red-brown rather than black as in C. cunninghamii . The status of the two species has been discussed by Brownsey & Perrie (2015a). They are very closely related but are retained here as species in the absence of any definitive evidence to the contrary. Cytology: 2n = 138 (Murray & de Lange 2013). Notes: Colenso’s No. 1780, chosen as the lectotype of Cyathea cunninghamii by Tindale (1956), was sent to W.J. Hooker in a letter initially dated 29 September 1848 and closed on 20 October. In the letter, Colenso stated “1780. Incipient fronds sprouting from a prostrate (felled) caudex, side of road. Caudex 9 feet long. Cyathea pulcherissima , W.C.” (St. George 2009). 9Fig. 14 : Cyathea cunninghamii . Mature plant with emergent crown of lacy fronds with narrow stipes.Fig. 15 : Cyathea cunninghamii .

Cyathea dealbata (G.Forst.),,2000-4000mm-long,"Cyathea dealbata occurs as a sub-canopy species under kauri, podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest, and in kānuka and mānuka scrub, usually in drier areas. It is occasionally found on bush margins and in more open areas, and has been recorded from amongst rushes in a dune slack. Recognition: Cyathea dealbata is usually immediately recognisable by the white colour of the undersurface of the fronds. Aberrant specimens, and very young plants, with grey-green, blue-green or green undersurfaces can be identified by the abundant curly hairs. The indusia are also distinctive at maturity when they form a deep cup-shape, but are best seen at senescence when the sporangia have been shed. Cyathea dealbata is morphologically very similar to C. milnei . The two taxa are characterised by abundant crisped or curled hairs on both surfaces of the laminae, and by indusia which open at maturity to form a deep cup that later breaks apart or spreads out to form a bowl shape. No other species in New Zealand have indusia of this type or such a preponderance of curled hairs. Cyathea milnei is distinguished by the green colour of the abaxial lamina surface compared to the distinctive white colour of most populations of C. dealbata , although there are several populations in northern New Zealand that have grey- or blue-green abaxial surfaces. Cyathea milnei also tends to have more persistent dead fronds on the trunks of mature plants, pale brown rather than white stipes and rachises, more conspicuously tuberculate stipe bases, proportionally fewer hairs and more scales on the abaxial costae, slightly larger sori (0.6–0.8 mm, cf. c. 0.5 mm wide), and more fragile indusia that break up easily. The status of the two species has been discussed by Brownsey & Perrie (2015a). They are very closely related, but are retained here as species in the absence of any definitive evidence to the contrary. 12Cytology: n = 69 (Brownlie 1958). Notes: There are three syntype specimens of Hemitelia falciloba Colenso in WELT (P002483–4, P003305), and two more at AK (136265, 136267). Allan (1961, p. 41) lectotypified one of the specimens in WELT (P003305) by describing uniquely the material (now on two sheets) as comprising “four partial pinnae (2 sterile, 2 fertile)”. Allan (1961, p. 40) also lectotypified Cyathea tricolor Colenso but the specimen in WELT is now missing, presumed lost, and a replacement lectotype at K was selected from syntypes in AK, K and WELT by Brownsey & Perrie (2015b). Rawlings (1969) reported an unusual form of Cyathea dealbata from Warawara Forest with prostrate rhizomes. Similar plants were reported by Bryony Macmillan from Warkworth (CHR 199046) and by Peter de Lange from Te Paki at Unuwhao Bush (AK 223017–9, 222931), near North Cape (AK 322831–3) and Radar Bush (WELT P027464). The fronds collected by Rawlings were said to be sterile and less white than usual in this species, and as “dirty-grey to glaucescent” by de Lange. Some other populations in northern New Zealand, from Raglan, Kāwhia and Waihi to North Cape, and from Coppermine Island, Rabbit Island, Goat Island and the Three Kings Islands, have blue-grey, grey- green or almost green abaxial surfaces but do not appear to differ in any other character from populations with white undersurfaces. Colenso’s C. tricolor , described from the Seventy Mile Bush between Norsewood and Dannevirke, was also noted for its “bluish tint”, as well as for its “shining dark green upper foliage” and “general and regular drooping appearance”. These plants appear to be at one end of clinal variation in C. dealbata and are not recognised taxonomically here. Kirk (1873) recorded a specimen of C. dealbata with a branching trunk and double crown, but suggested that it might have arisen as a result of damage to the growing point. He noted three other examples that he had seen with similar branching trunks. Fig. 23 : Cyathea dealbata . Mature plants with fronds held horizontally.Fig. 24 : Cyathea dealbata .

"Cyathea kermadecensis W.R.B.Oliv., Trans. & Proc. New Zealand Inst. 42: 158 (1910)",,2050-4000mm-long,"Cyathea kermadecensis grows in Metrosideros , Ascarina and Rhopalostylis forest in ravines, gullies and on cliffs, mostly in the higher and wetter parts of Raoul Island but also at lower elevations and drier sites. It is apparently less common than C. milnei (Sykes 1977). Recognition: Cyathea kermadecensis is morphologically very similar to C. cunninghamii . The two taxa share indusia which open at maturity to form a hood-shape, and a diverse array of very similar hairs and scales on the abaxial surface of the laminae. No other taxa in New Zealand or Australia have indusia of this type or such a diversity of scales and hairs. However, C. kermadecensis has a greater abundance of large pale brown scales on the abaxial surfaces of the costae than C. cunninghamii , and scattered, irregularly curled, acicular hairs on the abaxial costae which are usually absent in C. cunninghamii .

Cyathea medullaris (G.Forst.),,3000-5000mm-long,"Cyathea medullaris is a tall emergent species that occurs mostly in broadleaved forest, but also in podocarp, beech and kānuka forest and under introduced conifers and Salix species. It can be abundant in the initial forest formed on slips and other disturbed sites undergoing regeneration. It is a frost-tender species, and prefers damp habitats. Recognition: In the field Cyathea medullaris is readily distinguished by its tall trunk with black hexagonal stipe scars, and large arching fronds with thick black stipes. The lamina and stipe scales have dark red setae along both margins, which distinguishes this species from all other native species. Even very young plants of C. medullaris can be positively identified by this character. The naturalised C. cooperi has similar scales but is distinguished by its pale brown stipes and exindusiate sori. Plants of C. cunninghamii are superficially similar to C. medullaris but have more slender trunks covered in appressed stipe bases, shorter and more lacy fronds, and thinner stipes. C. cunninghamii also has scales that lack the marginal setae, and indusia that open to form a hood-shape, rather than splitting open irregularly. Cytology: n = 69 (Brownlie 1961). Notes: Cyathea polyneuron was described by Colenso (1879) from a plant he originally collected on Scinde Island, Napier. There are specimens in the Colenso Herbarium at WELT (P003306), in the Cheeseman Herbarium (AK 143439), and on two sheets at K. However, Allan (1961, p. 41) lectotypified the specimen at WELT, stating “the type in WELT consists of three portions of a rachis bearing in all 20 secondary pinnae…”, a description which accurately relates to WELT P003306 (now on two sheets). Cyathea medullaris var. integra was described by Hooker (1844–1846) from specimens collected by Colenso in New Zealand, but no material has been located at AK, K or WELT, which hold most of Colenso’s collections, and the type has been left undesignated (Brownsey & Perrie 2015b).

"Cyathea milnei Hook. ex Hook.f., Handb. New Zealand Fl., 349 (1864)",,1500-4000mm-long,"Cyathea milnei grows more commonly in drier Metrosideros forest at low altitudes on Raoul Island, but a few plants extend into the higher and wetter forest. It is apparently more common than C. kermadecensis (Sykes 1977). Recognition: Cyathea milnei is morphologically very similar to C. dealbata . The two taxa are characterised by abundant crisped or curled hairs on both surfaces of the laminae, and by indusia which open at maturity to form a deep cup that later breaks apart or spreads out to form a bowl shape. No other species in New Zealand have indusia of this type or such a preponderance of curled hairs. Cyathea milnei is distinguished by the green colour of the abaxial lamina surface compared to the distinctive white colour of most populations of C. dealbata , although there are several populations in northern New Zealand that have grey- or blue-green abaxial surfaces. Cyathea milnei also tends to have more persistent dead fronds on the trunks of mature plants, pale brown rather than white stipes and rachises, more conspicuously tuberculate stipe bases, proportionally fewer hairs and more scales on the abaxial costae, slightly larger sori (0.6–0.8 mm, cf. c. 0.5 mm wide), and more fragile indusia that break up easily. The status of the two species has been discussed by Brownsey & Perrie (2015a). They are very closely related but are retained here as species in the absence of any definitive evidence to the contrary. Notes: Cyathea milnei was described by Hooker (1864), but attributed to a manuscript description by William Hooker, based on specimens collected from the Kermadec Islands by John MacGillivray. In the Hookers’ Herbarium at K there are three sheets of material collected from the Kermadec Islands during the voyage of the Herald. Two were collected by W.G. Milne in 1855, and one by John MacGillivray in 1854. However, only the latter accords with Hooker’s protologue and is therefore the holotype. 22Fig. 58 : Cyathea milnei .

"Cyathea smithii Hook.f., Bot. Antarct. Voy. II (Fl. Nov.-Zel.)",,1650-3000mm-long,"Cyathea smithii is a hardy, subcanopy species which favours colder, wetter conditions, and is the dominant tree at higher altitudes and in the far south of the country. It occurs under podocarp, beech, kānuka and broadleaved forest. Recognition: Cyathea smithii is readily recognised in the field by its persistent dead stipes and rachises with abraded pinnae, which appear like a grass skirt around the trunk. The only other mainland New Zealand tree fern that regularly forms a skirt is Dicksonia fibrosa , where entire dead fronds are retained. Young immature plants of C. smithii are sometimes confused with C. colensoi , but fertile fronds are only produced on C. smithii when plants have developed trunks more than 1 m tall and can no longer be mistaken for C. colensoi . Cyathea smithii can be distinguished from C. cunninghamii by its saucer-shaped, rather than hood- shaped indusia. The pale brown lamina scales are also distinctive in lacking dark setae at the apex (Brownsey 1979), and the acaroid scales never have an expanded pale brown base, as is sometimes the case in C. cunninghamii . One collection of C. smithii from the Chatham Islands (WELT P021516) has larger pinnae than any mainland collection, with primary pinnae up to 600 mm long and 145 mm wide, secondary pinnae up 25to 80 mm long and 20 mm wide, and tertiary pinnae up to 14 mm long and 4 mm wide. It is unclear whether plants are generally bigger on the Chatham Islands. Cytology: n = 69 (Brownlie 1958). Notes: There are six syntype specimens of Hemitelia stellulata Colenso in WELT (P002506-10, P003307), another at AK (143440), and two at K. Allan (1961, p. 43) lectotypified one of the specimens in WELT (P003307) by describing uniquely the material on the sheet (“a portion of a rachis with 8 pinnae”). Buchanan (1887) recorded a specimen of C. smithii from Dunedin which branched to form several heads. Fig. 69 : Cyathea smithii .

It occurs under rocks and boulders, in sink-holes, in rock crevices and on wet rock faces, in caves, on stable scree, and on track and river banks, either in shaded rocky areas, subalpine grassland or under scrub, beech or podocarp forest. Recognition: Cystopteris tasmanica is an indigenous species, largely confined to limestone in montane to alpine areas. It is distinguished morphologically from the naturalised C. fragilis by its generally smaller and less divided laminae (1–2-pinnate cf. 2–3-pinnate), by its shorter and narrower primary pinnae (6–42 mm long, 4–24 mm wide cf. 16–95 mm long, 9–50 mm wide), and by the apices of its primary and secondary pinnae, which are obtuse or rounded rather than acute to acuminate.

Notes: New Zealand plants were misidentified as the European C. fragilis in most earlier New Zealand Floras (e.g. Hooker 1867; Cheeseman 1906, 1925; Allan 1961; Crookes 1963). They were referred to the South American C. fragilis var. apiiformis (Gand.) C.Chr. by Blasdell (1963). Whether or not Australasian material is identical to South American material remains to be determined, but in any event the name C. tasmanica (at species or varietal rank) has priority. Blasdell (1963) noted that minute glandular hairs are present on fronds of several species of Cystopteris . They have occasionally been observed on young living fronds of C. tasmanica , but they are apparently lost with maturity, and with drying, and have not been observed on herbarium material.

It occurs on damp soils, dunes, and coastal cliffs, beside lakes and swamps, on roadside banks and forest margins, in ditches, on alluvial flats and river banks, on rotten logs, in wind-thrown areas, on pumice, and along thermally heated creeks and soils. Recognition: In New Zealand, Histiopteris incisa can be recognised by its long-creeping rhizomes, glabrous and glaucous fronds (when young), presence of scales on the rhizome and stipe bases, sessile primary pinnae, reticulate venation, and sori more or less continuous around the ultimate lamina segments, protected by the inrolled lamina margins. Cytology: n = c. 96 (Brownlie 1961). Notes: Perrie et al. (2015) and Shinohara et al. (2021) have shown there are two widespread lineages within Histiopteris incisa. New Zealand plants are genetically distinct from those sampled in Fiji and New Caledonia. Both lineages occur in Japan, where they are sympatric and seem to be morphologically distinguishable. Further investigation is required, including to which lineage the name Histiopteris incisa belongs. Pteris alpina was proposed by Field (1890, p. 97) for what he thought might be a new species. He provided a description and illustration (Plate 28, fig. 2) of the plant which was ""in the possession of my nephew, Mr D.H. Munro, of Christchurch who obtained it from a toll-gate keeper at the Otairi [Otira] Gorge … who collected and pressed ferns for sale to travellers"". Field suggested that it might be an alpine form of Histiopteris incisa but stated that ""should it prove to be new to science, I would propose to call it ‘Pteris alpina’."" It is clear from this that Field did not definitely accept the species, and was simply proposing the name in anticipation of it being accepted later. Under Art. 36.1 of the Code, the name is therefore not validly published and has no status. 7Fig. 7 : Histiopteris incisa .

Evol. 127: 457 (2018) Type taxon: Hiya brooksiae (Alderw.) H.Shang Etymology: From the Chinese hiya (the name given to imperial guards from the Qing dynasty of China), a reference to the prickly, or very rough, armed stipes in some species. Terrestrial ferns. Rhizomes long-creeping, bearing red-brown or pale brown multicellular hairs. Fronds monomorphic, indeterminate with intermittent growth (not NZ) or determinate. Stipes hairy, spiny (not NZ) or rough. Laminae 2–4-pinnate, coriaceous, bearing non-glandular hairs, adaxial sulci of rachis and primary costae confluent; primary pinnae stalked, arising from rachis at ±90º, stipule-like pinnules present around resting buds of indeterminate fronds or absent. Veins free, reaching the lamina margin at indentations (NZ) or terminating at ± straight margin (not NZ). Sori round or elliptic, superficial, submarginal or submedial; paraphyses absent. Indusia either absent, or formed from partially reflexed, toothed lamina flaps, opening inwards; inner indusium absent. Spores monolete, echinate (not NZ) or smooth. Taxonomy: Hiya was distinguished by Shang et al. (2018) as a small genus of three species previously included within Hypolepis . However, Perrie et al. (2018) showed from a phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast DNA sequences that the Australasian H. distans was also embedded within Hiya, necessitating a revision of the generic description. Perrie et al. (2018) distinguished Hiya from Hypolepis on the basis that the adaxial sulci of the primary costae were confluent with the rachis, the lamina veins reached the margin at an indentation or where the margin was ± straight, and the basal primary pinnae arose from the rachis at ± 90º. By contrast, in Hypolepis ​​​​​​, the adaxial sulci of the primary costae were not confluent with the rachis, the lamina veins reached the margin where it was convex, and the basal primary pinnae arose from the rachis at an acute angle. Distribution: A genus of four species with one in the Neotropics from Mexico to Guyana and Bolivia, two in Malesia from peninsular Malaysia, Borneo, Sulawesi, Flores and New Guinea, and one in temperate Australia and New Zealand (Shang et al. 2018; Perrie et al. 2018). One non-endemic species in New Zealand. Biostatus: Indigenous (Non-endemic).

Cytology: The base chromosome number in Hiya is x = 28 or 29 (Brownsey 1983; Brownsey & Chinnock 1984).",,,,,,,,,25-130mm; 900mm-long; 1.5-10mm,Dennstaedtiaceae,"['indigenous', 'non-endemic']"
Hiya distans (Hook.),,120-1700mm-long,"Grows in swampy areas, bordering wetlands, on the bases of Carex secta in bogs, on peat or soils with a deep humus layer, in drainage ditches, on river terraces, on disturbed soils, on decomposing logs and humus mounds, in clearings, on road banks and on forest margins. The weak stipes of Hiya distans are unable to support the laminae, and plants often scramble over the substrate forming a mound of rhizome and fronds, or less commonly climb up through other vegetation. In northern New Zealand it is found in kauri forest or mānuka, but further south it grows under podocarp or broadleaved forest, or under mānuka and kānuka. It is also found under pines. Recognition: Hiya distans is a very distinct species recognised by its polished red-brown stipes, relatively narrow laminae, coriaceous texture, pinnae that arise at c. 90° to the rachis, veins that reach the margin at a sinus, well-developed indusia and dark brown spores that lack obvious projections. Cytology: n = 28 (Brownsey 1983; Brownsey & Chinnock 1984). 10Fig. 16 : Hiya distans .

Bot. 1(2): 34 (1805) Type taxon: Hypolepis tenuifolia (G.Forst.) Bernh. ex C.Presl Etymology: From the Greek hypo - (under) and lepis (a scale), a reference to the protection of the sori beneath a reflexed portion of the margin. Terrestrial ferns. Rhizomes long-creeping, bearing red-brown or pale brown multicellular hairs. Fronds monomorphic, usually determinate but rarely indeterminate (not NZ). Stipes hairy, smooth or rarely spiny (not NZ). Laminae 2–5-pinnate, herbaceous or coriaceous, bearing glandular and/or non- glandular hairs, adaxial sulci of rachis and primary costae not confluent; primary pinnae stalked, arising from rachis at acute angle, lacking basal pinnule-like stipules. Veins free, terminating at convex margin. Sori round or elliptic, superficial, submarginal; paraphyses present or absent. Indusia either absent, or formed from reflexed lamina flaps that vary from membranous and sharply reflexed to green and partially reflexed, opening inwards; inner indusium absent. Spores monolete, usually echinate and sometimes more or less reticulate. Taxonomy: Species of Hypolepis form a clearly defined genus distinct from the other genera in Dennstaedtiaceae on morphological (Brownsey 1998) and molecular grounds (Schuettpelz & Pryer 2007; Perrie et al. 2015). The genus has been revised in Australia (Brownsey & Chinnock 1984; Brownsey 1998), New Zealand (Brownsey & Chinnock 1984) and Malesia and the Pacific (Brownsey 1987), whilst the H. rugosula complex has been analysed worldwide by Schwartsburd & Prado (2014). The latter authors recognised 15 distinct geographic subspecies within H. rugosula , including the taxa that we recognise here as H. amaurorhachis , H. lactea and H. rufobarbata . In our opinion there is ample morphological evidence for recognising these three taxa as species in New Zealand, as well as a ploidy difference between them and H. rugosula in Australia.     1 Sori protected by well-developed, reflexed, partially membranous, lamina flaps; stipes 2–15 mm diameter .......................................................................... dicksonioides Sori unprotected, or protected only by slightly reflexed, green, lamina flaps; stipes 1–6 mm diameter ................................................................................................2 2 Abaxial surface of lamina and rachis bearing only non-glandular hairs ..................................3 Abaxial surface of lamina and rachis bearing at least some glandular hairs as well as acicular hairs ..................................................................................................4 3 Laminae up to 770 mm long and 400 mm wide; ultimate lamina segments less than 1 mm wide; paraphyses absent from sori ................................................ millefolium Laminae up to 1200 mm long and 1200 mm wide; ultimate lamina segments more than 1 mm wide; paraphyses sometimes present in sori .................. ambigua 124 Lamina margins bearing abundant red-brown (or occasionally colourless) acicular hairs; stipe and rachis purple-brown .......................................................... rufobarbata Lamina margins bearing colourless glandular or acicular hairs; stipe and rachis pale brown, red-brown or purple-brown ........................................................................5 5 Glandular hairs on laminae 0.1–0.3 mm long; stipe and rachis red-brown or purple-brown for at least ¾ their length; plants of North Island and northern South Island ...................................................................................................... lactea Glandular hairs on laminae 0.3–1.0 mm long; stipe and rachis red-brown for c. ½ their length; plants of southern South Island and subantarctic islands .............................................................................................................. amaurorhachis Distribution: A genus of perhaps 80 species (PPG 1 2016) in tropical and temperate regions of Central and South America, southern Africa, India, China, Japan, South-East Asia, Australasia and the Pacific (Brownsey 1998; Yan et al. 2013). There are about 50 species in the Americas (Schwartsburd 2018), three in Africa (Roux 2009), eight in China (Yan et al. 2013), 14 in Malesia and the Pacific (Brownsey 1987), and seven in Australia (Brownsey & Chinnock 1987).

Category Number Indigenous (Endemic) 4 Indigenous (Non-endemic) 2 Total 6 Recognition: In New Zealand, species of Hypolepis can be recognised by their creeping rhizomes, highly divided laminae bearing glandular or non-glandular hairs, and more or less round submarginal sori that are either unprotected, or protected by reflexed lamina flaps that open inwards. Cytology: The base chromosome number in Hypolepis is either x = 26 or x = 52.

Hypolepis amaurorhachis (Kunze),,240-1000mm-long,"Grows on open rocky slopes and terraces near the coast, in open Dracophyllum scrub, in Bulbinella herbfield, or on tracksides and riverbanks, and in light gaps under podocarp or rātā forest. Recognition: Hypolepis amaurorhachis is one of three similar species in New Zealand that have glandular hairs, red- or purple-brown stipes and rachises, and lack indusial flaps. It is distinguished from H. rufobarbata by the presence of colourless glandular and non-glandular hairs on the lamina margin in contrast to the abundant red-brown acicular hairs in H. rufobarbata . It also has colourless glandular hairs on the rachises and costae, whereas H. rufobarbata has red-brown glandular or acicular hairs. Hypolepis amaurorhachis is more similar to H. lactea but is distinguished by its paler red-brown stipe and rachis, becoming green in the distal half of the rachis, and by its longer glandular hairs on the laminae (0.3–0.7 cf. 0.1–0.3 mm long). Hypolepis amaurorhachis occurs only in the far south of the South Island and on the Chatham Islands and subantarctic islands, whereas H. lactea occurs in the North Island and South Island except for the far south. Hypolepis amaurorhachis can also be confused with H. ambigua , but is usually distinguished by the presence of glandular hairs and smaller spores (31–34 × 20–22 μm cf. 36–41 × 22–28 μm). Cytology: n = 52 (Brownsey & Chinnock 1984). Notes: In his original description of this species in Cheilanthes , Kunze (1850) used the epithet ""amaurorhachis "". When Hooker (1851–1858) made the new combination in Hypolepis he spelled the epithet "" amaurorachis "", incorrectly citing the spelling used by Kunze. This error was followed by Brownsey & Chinnock (1987) when reinstating the name for the Australasian species, and perpetuated by subsequent authors (e.g. Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth 2000). The original spelling used by Kunze is not an orthographic error and must therefore be retained as Hypolepis amaurorhachis . In New Zealand, this species has been widely misidentified as Polypodium viscidum Roxb., Polypodium rugosulum Labill., Polypodium punctatum Thunb., or combinations based on them. Hypolepis amaurorhachis occurs in both New Zealand and Australia, and, with n = 52, is cytologically distinct from the Australian H. rugosula , which has n = c. 104 (Brownsey & Chinnock 1987). We therefore recognise it here as a distinct species, rather than as a subspecies of H. rugosula as proposed by Schwartsburd & Prado (2014). 14Fig. 25 : Hypolepis amaurorhachis .

In forest situations it prefers disturbed soils and rotten logs, and in open areas it often grows with bracken. It can form extensive colonies spreading by means of its rapidly growing rhizomes, and may also grow as a weed in gardens. Recognition: Hypolepis ambigua is one of two Hypolepis species in New Zealand that lacks glandular hairs. It is distinguished from Hiya distans by its veins, which reach the margin at an apex rather than a sinus; by its distal pinnae, which arise at an acute angle to the rachis rather than at right angles; and by its stipes, which are much thicker (1–6 cf. 0.75–1.25 mm diameter). It is similar to H. millefolium but can be recognised by its larger fronds (up to 1200 mm long and 1200 mm wide, cf. 770 mm long and 400 mm wide), and by the broader ultimate segments (more than 1 mm wide cf. less 16than 1 mm wide). The two are also often ecologically separated, H. ambigua being more common in lowland sites, whereas H. millefolium generally occurs at higher elevations. Hypolepis ambigua is morphologically similar to H. dicksonioides , the two often growing together in thermal areas, but H. ambigua can be distinguished by its lack of glandular hairs, more slender stipes (1–6 cf. 2–15 mm diameter), and lack of well-developed indusia. Cytology: n = 104 (Brownlie 1954, 1957, as H. tenuifolia ; Brownlie 1961, as H. punctata ; Brownsey & Chinnock 1984). Hybridisation: There is evidence for hybridisation between H. ambigua and H. dicksonioides (AK 266639, CHR 212707, WELT P011525), H. lactea (AK 298766–298767), H. millefolium (WELT P011837) and H. rufobarbata (AK 170251, CHR 280735, WELT P011530). Hybrids can be recognised by their aborted spores (see Brownsey & Chinnock 1984). The combination H. ambigua × rufobarbata is found commonly where the two species occur together, whilst H. ambigua × dicksonioides arises frequently in thermal areas. Notes: In New Zealand this species has been widely misidentified by earlier authors as either Hypolepis tenuifolia (G.Forst.) Bernh. ex C.Presl or Hypolepis punctata (Thunb.) Mett. Hypolepis ambigua is morphologically very similar to H. polypodioides , a species which occurs from north-west India through southern China to the Philippines, peninsular Malaysia, Java and Flores (Brownsey 1987). Given the large distance between the distributions of the two species, it would be surprising if they were conspecific, but the possibility deserves further investigation.

Hypolepis dicksonioides (Endl.),,220-2450mm-long; 17-360mm-long; 7-170mm-wide; 4mm-long; 2mm-wide,"Grows in open places, on rocky coastal slopes, among boulders, at cliff bases, on pumice beds and scoria (where it is often very stunted), on thermally heated soil and along hot streams, in ditches, on roadsides, in poor pasture, on old logs, on forest margins, in open coastal forest and forest clearings, and under Pinus plantations. It prefers disturbed or sandy soils, and sometimes grows amongst bracken. It also appears as a weed in gardens and urban environments. Recognition: Hypolepis dicksonioides is generally the largest of all the New Zealand species (except for stunted fronds found growing on pumice), and can be confused only with H. ambigua , with which it often grows in thermal sites. Hypolepis dicksonioides can be distinguished by its long, colourless, glandular hairs, thicker stipes (5–15 cf. 1.5–6 mm diameter), and well-developed indusial flaps. Cytology: n = 104 (Brownsey & Chinnock 1984). Hybridisation: There is evidence for hybridisation between H. dicksonioides and H. ambigua (AK 266639, CHR 212707, WELT P011525) and H. lactea (WELT P011537). Hybrids can be recognised by their aborted spores (see Brownsey & Chinnock 1984). The combination H. ambigua × dicksonioides occurs frequently in thermal areas where the two parents are found together. Notes: In New Zealand this species has been widely misidentified by earlier authors as Hypolepis tenuifolia (G.Forst.) Bernh. ex C.Presl. Brownsey (1987) noted that Hypolepis dicksonioides has a disjunct distribution, with lowland populations occurring in New Zealand (from sea level, reaching 750 m around thermal areas), the Kermadec Islands (up to 250 m) and Norfolk Island (up to 300 m), and higher-altitude populations on Samoa (1200–1700 m), Tahiti (785–1560 m) and the Marquesas Islands (1020 m). However, populations in Samoa have smaller spores (32–33 μm long, 20–21 μm wide) than those from elsewhere (38–43 μm long, 22–26 μm wide). Whether this is indicative of a difference in chromosome number, and perhaps a different taxon, requires further investigation. 19Fig. 39 : Hypolepis dicksonioides .

Bot. 22: 55 (1984)",,240-1100mm; 1900mm-long; 4mm-long; 2.5mm-wide,"Grows on swampy and peaty soils, on the bases of Carex secta in bogs, on disturbed or stony ground in forest and scrub, in clearings, on bush margins, clay banks, stream banks, drainage ditches, and roadsides, at the base of uprooted trees, and on rotting logs. It occurs in kauri, podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, and under mānuka. It is similar in its ecological tolerances to H. rufobarbata , but occurs generally at lower altitudes. Recognition: Hypolepis lactea is one of three similar species in New Zealand that have glandular hairs, red- or purple-brown stipes and rachises, and lack indusial flaps. It is distinguished from H. rufobarbata by the presence of colourless glandular and non-glandular hairs on the lamina margin in contrast to the abundant red-brown acicular hairs in H. rufobarbata . Hypolepis lactea is further distinguished by its milky exudate on the adaxial lamina surface at maturity, and by its veins, which are sometimes slightly excurrent. It also has abundant short, colourless glandular hairs on the rachises and costae, in contrast to H. rufobarbata , which has red-brown glandular or acicular hairs. Hypolepis lactea is more similar to H. amaurorhachis but is distinguished by its darker purple-brown stipe and rachis, which become green only at the far distal end, and by its shorter glandular hairs on the laminae (0.1–0.3 cf. 0.3–0.7 mm long). The distributions of the two species do not overlap, H. lactea being a plant of the North Island and South Island except for the far south, whereas H. amaurorhachis occurs only in the far south of the South Island and on the subantarctic islands. Cytology: n = 52 (Brownsey & Chinnock 1984). Hybridisation: There is evidence for hybridisation between H. lactea and H. ambigua (AK 298766–298767) and H. dicksonioides (WELT P011537). Hybrids can be recognised by their aborted spores (see Brownsey & Chinnock 1984). There is also some morphological evidence that H. lactea and H. rufobarbata hybridise when they occur together (AK 270457–60, CHR 323893, WELT P011467), but no aborted spores have been found and further work is needed to determine whether such hybrids exist and whether they retain some degree of fertility (Brownsey & Chinnock 1984). Notes: In New Zealand this species has been widely misidentified by earlier authors as Polypodium rugosulum Labill., P. punctatum Thunb., or combinations based on them. Hypolepis lactea is morphologically and cytologically distinct from the Australian H. rugosula , which has n = c. 104 (Brownsey & Chinnock 1987). We therefore recognise it here as a distinct species, rather than as a subspecies of H. rugosula as proposed by Schwartsburd & Prado (2014). 22Fig. 50 : Hypolepis lactea .

"Hypolepis millefolium Hook., Sp. Fil. 2, 68, t. 95b (1852)",,120-1000mm-long,"Grows in open rocky places, on shingle slides, in tussock grassland and shrubland, on open hillsides and pasture, in subalpine scrub and herbfield, on forest margins, in forest clearings, along tracksides and streambanks, in forest, on swamp margins and on road banks. It occurs in podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest and under mānuka and plantations of conifers. It often forms extensive colonies by means of its underground rhizomes, and is deciduous in winter. Recognition: Hypolepis millefolium is one of two Hypolepis species in New Zealand that lack glandular hairs. It is distinguished from Hiya distans by its veins, which reach the margin at an apex rather than a sinus; by its distal pinnae, which arise at an acute angle to the rachis rather than at right angles; and by its thicker stipes (1–3 cf. 0.75–1.25 mm diameter). It is similar to H. ambigua but can be recognised by its smaller fronds (up to 770 mm long and 400 mm wide, cf. 1200 mm long and 1200 mm wide), and narrower ultimate segments (less than 1 mm wide cf. more than 1 mm wide). The 24two are also often ecologically separated, H. millefolium generally occurring at higher elevations whereas H. ambigua is more common in lowland sites. Cytology: n = 52 (Brownlie 1958; Brownsey & Chinnock 1984). Hybridisation: There is evidence for hybridisation between H. millefolium and H. ambigua (WELT P011837) and H. rufobarbata (CHR 221720).

Hypolepis rufobarbata (Colenso),,115-1180mm-long; 0.25-0.5mm-long; 1mm-long,"Grows on disturbed or boggy soils, swamp margins, rocky ground, clay banks, stream banks, tracksides, and road banks, at the base of uprooted trees, on rotting logs, in humus, on bush margins, in clearings, under scrub, and in forest. It does not tolerate competition from other species and is a coloniser of open ground in damp forested or shaded areas. It grows in podocarp, broadleaved, beech and pine forest, and under mānuka and kānuka. Recognition: Hypolepis rufobarbata is one of three similar species in New Zealand that have glandular hairs, red- or purple-brown stipes and rachises, and lack indusial flaps. Hypolepis rufobarbata is distinguished from H. lactea and H. amaurorhachis by the presence of abundant red- brown acicular hairs on the lamina margin, in contrast to the other two species, which have only colourless glandular or acicular hairs on the margins. Hypolepis lactea is further distinguished by its milky exudate on the adaxial lamina surface at maturity, and by its veins, which are sometimes slightly excurrent. It also has abundant short, colourless, glandular hairs on the rachises and costae, in contrast to H. rufobarbata , which has red-brown glandular or acicular hairs. Hypolepis amaurorhachis is further distinguished by its paler red-brown stipe and rachis becoming green in the distal half. Cytology: n = 52 (Brownlie 1954, 1957, as H. rugosula ; Brownsey & Chinnock 1984). Hybridisation: There is evidence for hybridisation between H. rufobarbata and H. ambigua (AK 170251, CHR 280735, WELT P007817) and H. millefolium (CHR 221720). Hybrids can be recognised by their aborted spores (see Brownsey & Chinnock 1984). The combination H. ambigua × rufobarbata is found commonly where the two species occur together. There is also some morphological evidence that H. rufobarbata and H. lactea hybridise when they occur together (CHR 323893, WELT P011467), but no aborted spores have been found and further work is needed to determine whether such hybrids exist and whether they retain some degree of fertility (Brownsey & Chinnock 1984).

Terrestrial ferns. Rhizomes long-creeping, bearing chestnut-brown multicellular hairs. Fronds monomorphic. Stipes hairy. Laminae 3–4-pinnate-pinnatifid, herbaceous, bearing non-glandular hairs; primary pinnae stalked, lacking basal pinnule-like stipules. Veins free. Sori round or oblong, superficial, submarginal; paraphyses absent. Indusia ovate or triangular, attached at base but not the sides, opening towards the margin. Spores trilete, coarsely verrucate. Taxonomy: Leptolepia is a monotypic genus endemic to New Zealand, distinguished by its ovate or triangular, toothed indusium attached only at the base and opening towards the margin. Leptolepia novae-zelandiae nests with Oenotrichia maxima in one of the clades of Dennstaedtia (Perrie et al. 2015). However, it is currently far from clear what the generic limits should be in this part of the Dennstaedtiaceae , and Leptolepia is retained here as a monotypic genus until the group is investigated further.

It favours damp soils in gullies and on stream banks, river terraces, banks, and tracksides, and occasionally on rotting logs. Recognition: Leptolepia novae-zelandiae can be recognised by its creeping rhizomes, red-brown or chestnut-brown stipes and rachises, highly divided laminae bearing non-glandular multicellular hairs, and round submarginal sori that are protected by ovate or triangular indusia opening towards the lamina margin.

Pterid. 124, t. 4 (1836) Type taxon: Microlepia polypodioides (Sw.) C.Presl Etymology: From the Greek mikros (small) and lepis (a scale), a reference to the nature of the indusia. Terrestrial ferns. Rhizomes short- to long-creeping, bearing multicellular hairs. Fronds monomorphic. Stipes hairy. Laminae 2–3-pinnate (NZ) or 1-pinnate or 4-pinnate (not NZ), herbaceous (NZ) or coriaceous (not NZ), bearing non-glandular hairs; primary pinnae stalked, lacking basal pinnule-like stipules. Veins free. Sori round (NZ) or broader than long (not NZ), on a slightly raised receptacle, submarginal; paraphyses present (NZ) or absent (not NZ). Indusia half-cup-shaped, attached at base and sides (NZ), or rarely cup-shaped (not NZ). Spores trilete, finely echinate or almost smooth. Taxonomy: Microlepia is closely related to, and often difficult to distinguish from, Dennstaedtia . Molecular evidence (Schuettpelz & Pryer 2007; Perrie et al. 2015) suggests that it is monophyletic and sister to one clade of Dennstaedtia . It is slightly more homogeneous cytologically than Dennstaedtia , with base chromosome numbers of x = 40, 42, 43 and c. 44 reported (Brownsey 1998). The genus is in need of revision. Distribution: A genus of one pantropical species and about 60 species in the Asia–Pacific region (PPG 1 2016), with 25 species in China (Yan et al. 2013), six in Malaya (Holttum 1968), seven in the Philippines (Copeland 1958), five in New Guinea (Copeland 1950), one in Australia (Brownsey 1998), and about five in the Pacific. One species occurs as a casual in New Zealand. Biostatus: Exotic; casual. Table : Number of species in New Zealand within Microlepia C.Presl Category Number Exotic: Casual 1 Total 1 Recognition: In New Zealand, Microlepia can be recognised by its creeping rhizomes, highly divided laminae bearing non-glandular hairs, more or less round submarginal sori, and half-cup-shaped indusia attached at the base and sides. Notes: Microlepia was described by Presl (1836) but is pre-dated by Scyphofilix , published 30 years earlier by Thouars (1806). They were both lectotypified with the same type by Farwell (1931), who argued that Scyphofilix had priority over Microlepia . Nevertheless, Farwell’s work has been ignored and Microlepia almost universally adopted as the name for this genus. Schwartsburd (2017) proposed that Microlepia should be conserved against Scyphofilix .",,65-530mm-long; 40-500mm-wide,2mm-long,,,,,,20-175mm; 40-675mm-long; 0.5-4mm,Dennstaedtiaceae,"['indigenous', 'endemic']"

Paesia scaberula (A.Rich.),,150-1175mm-long; 25-265mm-long; 11-90mm-wide,"Paesia scaberula often forms extensive populations in reverting pasture, grassy clearings, and on stabilised dunes and waste ground. It also grows in roadside ditches and banks, along tracksides, in light gaps in forest, on rotten wood, on swamp and forest margins, in pākihi, along stream beds and hot streams, in modified tussock, and on scree. It mostly grows in the open, but also occurs under podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, under mānuka and kānuka, in coastal scrub, under pine plantations and with bracken. Recognition: Paesia scaberula can be recognised by its long-creeping rhizomes, highly divided and slightly dimorphic laminae bearing glandular hairs, zigzag rachises, and sori that are more or less continuous around the lamina margins, protected by the inrolled lamina margin and a true inner indusium. The sterile pinnae are more divided than the fertile pinnae. 35Very occasional crested forms are found with the apices of the pinnae divided multiple times.  Cytology: n = 26 (Brownlie 1954, 1957).

Kuhn Etymology: Diminutive of the Greek pteris (a fern). Terrestrial ferns. Rhizomes long-creeping, bearing multicellular hairs. Fronds monomorphic. Stipes hairy. Laminae 2–5-pinnate, coriaceous, bearing non-glandular hairs; primary pinnae stalked, sometimes with reduced stipule-like basal pinnules. Veins free except for a marginal connecting vein. Sori more or less continuous around the lamina margin borne on the connecting vein, superficial; paraphyses absent. Outer indusium formed from the reflexed membranous lamina margin, opening inwards; inner indusium poorly developed or absent. Spores trilete, irregularly granulate. Taxonomy: Pteridium is clearly defined and forms a clade along with Paesia , Saccoloma , Histiopteris and Blotiella within Dennstaedtiaceae (Perrie et al. 2015). It is a worldwide genus variously interpreted as having a single species with two subspecies and a number of varieties (Tryon 1941; Page 1976; Tryon & Tryon 1982; Kramer 1990), or perhaps four closely related species and several subspecies (Brownsey 1989, 1998; Der et al. 2009; Thomson 2012; Zhou et al. 2014). Recent analyses of sequence data suggest that there are two major diploid clades corresponding to P. aquilinum in the Northern Hemisphere and Africa, and P. esculentum in South America, Australia, New Zealand and south-east Asia. There is also evidence for two allotetraploid species – P. semihastatum in northern Australia and south-east Asia, and P. caudatum in Central and South America (Thomson & Alonso- Amelot 2002; Der et al. 2009; Zhou et al. 2014). However, some authors have continued to recognise additional species in South America (Schwartsburd et al. 2014) and China (Liao et al. 2013). Distribution: A subcosmopolitan genus interpreted here as having four closely related species and several subspecies. There are two species in Australia (Brownsey 1989, 1998) and one in the Pacific.

Etymology: From the Latin esculentus (edible), a reference to the use of bracken rhizomes as a food source, especially by Māori. Vernacular names: austral bracken; bracken Terrestrial ferns. Rhizomes long-creeping, bearing multicellular hairs. Fronds 250–2000 mm long or more. Stipes 1–10 mm diameter, bearing petiolar roots distally above the junction with the rhizome. Rachises with swollen nectaries at the base of the primary pinnae. Laminae 2-pinnate-pinnatifid to 5- pinnate, broadly ovate or broadly elliptic, bearing hairs, lacking scales. Some lamina segments adnate at base with long-decurrent bases either extending along the axes, or often becoming separated as free lobes forming narrow wings. Ultimate lamina segments linear and entire; adaxial surface dark green and glossy; abaxial surface paler green, bearing white hairs and minute gnarled trichomes that create a farinaceous or mealy appearance. When fertile, sori almost continuous along margins of ultimate segments, protected by the inrolled lamina margin. Distribution: North Island: Northland, Auckland, Volcanic Plateau, Gisborne, Taranaki, Southern North Island. South Island: Western Nelson, Sounds-Nelson, Marlborough, Westland, Canterbury, Otago, Southland, Fiordland. Kermadec Islands, Three Kings Islands, Chatham Islands, Stewart Island, Antipodes Island. Altitudinal range: 0–1000 m. Pteridium esculentum occurs on Raoul Island (Sykes & West 1996), the Three Kings Islands, and in coastal, lowland, and montane sites throughout the North Island and much of the South Island. It has been little documented from the driest parts of south Canterbury and Otago. In the North Island it grows from near sea level to over 1000 m in the northern Ruahine Ranges, and in the South Island up to 1000 m on Mt Benmore, Marlborough. It also occurs on Stewart Island, the Chatham Islands, and Antipodes Island. Also Australia (Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania), Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga, Central America from Mexico south, Caribbean islands, South America except Chile (see Brownsey 1989; Thomson 2012). Biostatus: Indigenous (Non-endemic). Habitat: Pteridium esculentum is a serious weed of pasture, aggressively invading cleared or burnt land and forming extensive populations by means of its underground rhizomes. It eventually disappears under regenerating scrub and forest. It is found in rough and reverting pasture, on road cuttings and banks, in ditches, on lake and forest margins, in peat bogs, on old sand dunes, on cliff faces, in forest clearings and disturbed ground, along river beds and terraces, in tussock land, and on heated ground. Although mostly found in the open, it also occurs under podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, under mānuka and kānuka, in coastal and other scrub, and under pine plantations. Recognition: Pteridium esculentum is distinguished from the northern hemisphere diploid species, P. aquilinum , by the presence of petiolar roots at the base of the stipe above the junction with the rhizome, winged axes that appear as free lobes or as long-decurrent bases to the lamina segments (Thomson 2016), and gnarled trichomes on the abaxial lamina surface that cause a farinaceous or mealy appearance (Thomson 2012). These features are all absent in P. aquilinum . Cytology: n = 52 (Brownlie 1954, 1957). Notes: Thomson (2012) recognised two species of diploid bracken: the predominantly northern hemisphere Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn and the mainly southern hemisphere Pteridium esculentum . 38He further recognised 11 subspecies within P. aquilinum and two subspecies within P. esculentum – subsp. esculentum confined to Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Vanuatu, Fiji and Tonga, and subsp. arachnoideum (Kaulf.)

Although mostly found in the open, it also occurs under podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, under mānuka and kānuka, in coastal and other scrub and under pine plantations. Recognition: Pteridium esculentum subsp. esculentum can be recognised by its long-creeping rhizomes, highly divided laminae, with the pinnae and pinna segments arising at 90° to their axes, abaxial lamina surfaces bearing straight, white, appressed, acicular hairs along the veins of the ultimate segments and curly brown, non-glandular hairs on the costae, and sori that are more or less continuous around the lamina margins protected by the inrolled lamina margin and a poorly developed inner indusium. Fronds vary immensely in size from dwarf forms only about 200 mm long up to fronds 3–4 m in length, much longer than the dimensions given in the description above, which are based solely on herbarium specimens.

"Dicksonia fibrosa Colenso in Hooker, Sp. Fil. 1, 68 (1844)",,1100-3000mm-long,"Occurs under tall mānuka and kānuka scrub, on forest margins, or in podocarp and broad- leaved forest in the northern part of its range, and podocarp or beech forest in the southern part. It grows on flood plains, riverbanks, streamsides, swamp margins and on hillsides, but can also tolerate forest margins, open pastures or scrubland. Recognition: Dicksonia fibrosa is recognised by its thick fibrous trunk, skirt of persistent entire dead fronds, and crown of short-stalked and rather narrow fronds. The pair of basal primary pinnae are less than 95 mm long. New fronds are produced in flushes in spring, and are initially held upright, gradually drooping lower as they mature and die to form the skirt. Cytology: n = 65 (Brownlie 1954, 1957). Notes: This species was first collected by Colenso during his journey through the Urewera Ranges in 1841–42, and later published as D. fibrosa in the Tasmanian Journal of Natural Sciences (Colenso 1845). Until recently, this has been accepted as the earliest validly published description (Brownsey et al. 1985). However, Colenso sent a specimen (No. 289) and a copy of an unpublished description to W.J. Hooker in a letter dated 1 September 1842 (see St. George 2009). Hooker then used Colenso's 4specimen and description to draw up his own description for inclusion in Species Filicum (Hooker 1844). He specifically says about D. fibrosa , “of this species I only possess portions of a large frond, with copious fructifications. But, happily, Mr Colenso's description is before me, from which I have been able to improve the specific character”. He attributes the name to Colenso, includes a portion of Colenso’s description in quotation marks, and cites Colenso’s article in the Tasmanian Journal of Natural Science , albeit without volume or page numbers. Hooker did not intend to pre-empt Colenso, expecting Colenso's description to have been published before his, but in the event Species Filicum appeared in print first, and is the first validly published description for the species. Because Hooker attributed the name and part of the description to Colenso, the species must be cited as Dicksonia fibrosa Colenso in Hook. (K. Gandhi, pers. comm. – Art. 46.2 Note 1). There are two specimens collected by Colenso from the Te Waiiti district – one at WELT (P003256), and the other at K ( Colenso 289 ). Both specimens are very similar, comprising three pinna pairs from the mid-portion of the lamina. The sheet at K also has an unattached pinna, while that at WELT has a portion of the frond apex. Allan (1961) lectotypified the WELT specimen. Colenso also described the species twice more as D. sparmanniana and D. microcarpa , but these are just minor variants of his original species. There are several syntype specimens of both D. sparmanniana and D. microcarpa in WELT, but, for both taxa, the description by Allan (1961) of the type material on a particular sheet (e.g. “…a portion of the rachis with 7 pinnae…”) constitutes lectotypification. Dicksonia intermedia Colenso ex Hook. & Baker (1874), cited under D. fibrosa by Allan (1961), is a nomen nudum . The status of D. fibrosa as a species distinct from the Australian D. antarctica requires further investigation. Hooker (1867) could not find any difference between the two and treated the New Zealand plant as D. antarctica . Kirk (1878) reduced it to a variety of D. antarctica , noting its smaller size, hairy rachis, more compact habit and less coriaceous texture. Cheeseman (1925) accepted it as D. fibrosa only rather reluctantly, stating that it was “very close indeed to the Australian D. antarctica ”, differing in being a smaller plant with densely hairy rachises and smaller sori. Cheeseman’s recognition of D. fibrosa has been followed by later authors (e.g. Allan 1961; Brownsey et al. 1985). Page & Hollands (1992) identified a number of characters for distinguishing Australian and New Zealand species of Dicksonia in cultivation in Britain, including D. antarctica and D. fibrosa . However, many of the measurements given do not apply to the two species in the wild, and the comparison is therefore of limited value. In fact, the most striking difference between the two species, not mentioned by any of the above authors, is that D. fibrosa has a thick skirt of dead fronds surrounding the trunk, which D. antarctica lacks. The primary pinnae of D. antarctica are generally broader than those of D. fibrosa , and the stipes often rather longer. Also, Janssen et al. (2008) found a small genetic difference between the two species, which may be significant given the deceleration of molecular evolution observed in tree ferns (Korall et al. 2010). These differences suggest that two species should continue to be recognised for the time being.

Fil. 1, 69 (1844) ≡ Balantium lanatum (Colenso ex Hook.) Fée, Mém. Foug., 5. Gen. Filic., 341 (1852) Holotype: New Zealand, W. Colenso 271 , Herb. Hooker., K! (photo WELT E470/10) Etymology: From the Latin lanatus (woolly), a reference to the woolly hairs on the underside of the laminae of this species. Vernacular names: stumpy tree fern; tūākura; tūōkura Rhizomes either prostrate, up to 50 mm diam., branching and stoloniferous, or erect, forming a woody trunk 0.2–2 m tall, 50–150 mm diam., covered in brown adventitious roots and brown stipe bases; lacking buds, bearing red-brown multicellular hairs near the apex. Fronds 400–2000 mm long, held erect, falling when old; dead fronds orange-brown. Stipes 210–1170 mm long, red-brown at very base, becoming chestnut-brown or yellow-brown or green distally, or occasionally green throughout, smooth, often bearing fine golden-brown hairs at the junction with the rhizome, densely covered in red-brown multicellular hairs up to 35 mm long proximally, and pale brown or chestnut-brown hairs to 8 mm long distally. Laminae 2-pinnate-pinnatisect to 3-pinnate (sterile pinnae) or 3-pinnate-pinnatifid (fertile pinnae), ovate or triangular, 240–1130 mm long, 140–700 mm wide, coriaceous, smooth, abundantly hairy on abaxial surfaces of rachis, pinna midribs and costae; hairs more or less straight and rigid, interspersed with shorter fine hairs, or in dense woolly patches; rachis yellow-brown or green. Primary pinnae in 13–23 pairs, ovate, narrowly ovate, triangular or narrowly triangular; the longest below the middle, 95–425 mm long, 35–165 mm wide, stalked; the basal pair 100–340 mm long. Secondary pinnae narrowly ovate or narrowly triangular, the longest 20–85 mm long, 7–25 mm wide, stalked. Longest tertiary pinnae 3–14 mm long, 1.5–6 mm wide, stalked or sessile or adnate, the fertile ones divided more than halfway to midrib; ultimate segments slightly rounded. Sori terminating veins at margins of lamina, ovate, 1–2 mm long, slightly elongated along the lamina margin. Distribution: North Island: Northland, Auckland, Volcanic Plateau, Gisborne, Taranaki, Southern North Island. South Island: Western Nelson, Sounds–Nelson, Westland. Altitudinal range: 10–1400 m. In the North Island D. lanata occurs in coastal and lowland forest from North Cape to Coromandel, and in montane forest or open scrub from Thames south to the Ruahine Ranges, with an outlying population in the southern Tararua Ranges. It is apparently absent from much of Taranaki, the Tararua Ranges and the east coast, although there is a single dubious record from Mt Egmont (WELT P005570, without collector, date or specific locality). It occurs from near sea level to 1100 m in the Urewera region and 1400 m in the Ruahine Ranges. In the South Island it grows mainly in coastal and lowland forest, occurring on Mt Stokes in the Marlborough Sounds, and along the west coast from north-west Nelson to Lake Moeraki, South Westland. It reaches 750 m above Boulder Lake, north- west Nelson. Biostatus: Indigenous (Endemic). Habitat: In the northern part of its range it occurs in lowland kauri, podocarp or taraire forest, in mature mānuka or kānuka scrub, and occasionally in gumland. South of Thames it is found in open scrub, and in podocarp, beech or broadleaved forest. Recognition: Dicksonia lanata has smooth fronds and ovate or triangular laminae. It has two distinct subspecies (Brownsey & Perrie 2014). One is a short-trunked plant found principally in kauri forests north of Auckland. It is distinguished from D. squarrosa by its brown rather than almost black trunk and stipe bases, and also lacks the orange-brown dead fronds and aerial buds of that species. It is distinguished from D. fibrosa by its narrower trunk and lack of a skirt of dead fronds. The second subspecies is very distinctive in being a prostrate plant, lacking a trunk. It produces stolons and grows as thick, tangled colonies. Cytology: n = 65 (Brownlie 1961) Notes: As with D. fibrosa , this species was first collected by Colenso during his journey through the Urewera Ranges in 1841–42, and later published as D. lanata in the Tasmanian Journal of Natural Sciences (Colenso 1845). Until recently, this has been accepted as the earliest validly published description (Brownsey et al. 1985). However, Colenso sent a specimen (No. 271) and copy of an unpublished description to W.J. Hooker in a letter dated 1 September 1842 (see St. George 2009). Hooker then used Colenso's specimens and descriptions to draw up his own description for inclusion in Species Filicum (Hooker 1844). He attributed the name to Colenso, and cites Colenso’s article in 7the Tasmanian Journal of Natural Science . Hooker did not intend to pre-empt Colenso, expecting Colenso's description to have been published before his, but in the event Species Filicum appeared in print first, and is the first validly published description for the species. Because, in this case, Hooker attributed only the name to Colenso, without any part of Colenso’s description, the species must be cited as D. fibrosa Colenso ex Hook. (K. Gandhi, pers. comm. – Art. 46). The specimen collected by Colenso from the shores of Waikare Lake in December 1841 (WELT P003258), and cited by Allan (1961) as the type, was not seen by Hooker and therefore cannot be considered part of the original material.

Dicksonia lanata subsp. hispida (Colenso),420-1130mm-long; 200-700mm-wide,500-2000mm-long,"Dicksonia lanata subsp. hispida occurs most frequently in lowland kauri, podocarp or taraire forest, but is also found in mature mānuka or kānuka scrub, and occasionally on gumland. Recognition: Dicksonia lanata subsp. hispida is a short-trunked tree fern found most commonly as an understorey plant in kauri forest. It is distinguished from subsp. lanata by the presence of a trunk, and by the presence of rigid, multicellular, red-brown hairs among shorter, pale brown hairs on the abaxial surfaces of the costae and pinna midribs. It lacks the dense patches of long, woolly, curled hairs present in subsp. lanata , but the hairs are sometimes slightly clustered in sterile fronds. 8In the absence of hairs, subsp. hispida can sometimes be distinguished by its darker green laminae; sterile lamina segments, which tend to be flat or slightly involute; fertile pinnae, which are sometimes markedly reduced compared with the sterile; somewhat longer and narrower tertiary pinnae; and only one sorus on the lowermost ultimate segments of the tertiary pinnae. Notes: This taxon was first collected by Colenso from the Bay of Islands and a specimen (No. 351) sent to William Hooker at Kew in a letter dated 20 May 1844, together with a manuscript entitled Filices Novae in which it was described as a new variety (see St. George 2009). Colenso later published the variety as D. lanata var. hispida in the Tasmanian Journal of Natural Sciences (Colenso 1845). However, before then, Hooker cited Colenso's specimen and his full description in Species Filicum (Hooker 1844). Hooker did not intend to pre-empt Colenso, expecting Colenso's description to have been published before his, but in the event, Species Filicum appeared in print first, and is the first validly published description for the variety. Because Hooker attributed the name and full description to Colenso, the variety must be cited as D. lanata var. hispida Colenso in Hooker (Art. 46.2 Note 1). The variety was raised to subspecific rank by Brownsey & Perrie (2014).

"Dicksonia lanata Colenso ex Hook., Sp. Fil. 1, 69 (1844)",240-760mm-long; 140-500mm-wide,400-1750mm-long; 2000mm-long,"In the North Island, D. lanata subsp. lanata is found in open scrub, and in montane podocarp, beech or broadleaved forest. In the South Island it occurs at lower elevations in mixed podocarp or beech forest. Recognition: Dicksonia lanata subsp. lanata is very distinctive in being a prostrate plant, lacking the trunk of subsp. hispida . It produces stolons and grows as thick, tangled colonies. It can usually be recognised in most of its range by the dense patches of long, woolly, curled, pale or chestnut-brown hairs that are present on the abaxial surface of the lamina at the costa junctions. Rigid, red-brown hairs are usually absent. However, populations around Thames, at the northernmost limit of the subspecies, are uncharacteristic in having long, rigid, straight, chestnut- brown hairs that are more uniformly distributed. The hairs are longer than in subsp. hispida and are chestnut-brown rather than red-brown. The hair characters of these populations do not accord with those of either subspecies. However, the lack of a trunk suggests that the plants belong to subsp. lanata . 11In the absence of hairs, subsp. lanata can sometimes be distinguished by its paler green laminae; sterile lamina segments, which tend to be slightly revolute; fertile pinnae, which are only slightly reduced compared with the sterile; somewhat shorter and broader tertiary pinnae; and more than one sorus on the lowermost ultimate segments of the tertiary pinnae.

Dicksonia squarrosa (G.Forst.),1000-1400mm-long; 400-600mm-wide,1250-2400mm-long,"Occurs under mānuka, tawa, pōhutukawa, podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest, or in second-growth forest, open scrub, on forest margins, and occasionally in dune hollows or open pasture. It often grows along creek banks, or on poorly-drained or swampy soil. It frequently forms extensive groves; the dense shade, combined with the dead fronds that cover the ground, tends to discourage germination of any other species underneath the grove. Recognition: Dicksonia squarrosa is readily recognised by the black stipe bases on the trunk, the presence of aerial buds, the very harsh fronds, and the characteristically orange-brown dead fronds. There are red-brown, rigid, multicellular, uniformly distributed hairs on the abaxial surface of the costae. If the crown or upper part of the trunk is damaged, the aerial buds may grow out to form a multi-headed tree fern. The stoloniferous habit means that the species often grows in groves, with a mixture of young and old trunks. Cytology: n = 65 (Brownlie 1954, 1957) Notes: There are two syntype specimens of D. gracilis in WELT but Allan (1961) effectively identified the lectotype by describing uniquely the material on the sheet (“… a small part of a rachis with 6 pinnae …”). 14Fig. 31 : Dicksonia squarrosa : mature plants growing in a grove, showing orange-brown dead fronds.Fig. 32 : Dicksonia squarrosa : mature plants growing a grove, showing orange-brown dead fronds.

Arachniodes aristata (G.Forst.),,680-1050mm-long,"Arachniodes aristata was reported to be the commonest terrestrial fern of dry forest areas on Raoul Island, but absent from wet forest and swamp (Sykes 1977). It has been collected from roadsides and damp banks. Recognition: Arachniodes aristata is recognised by its terrestrial habit, long-creeping rhizomes, 3–4- pinnate laminae with sharply toothed margins, scaly fronds, and round sori protected by reniform indusia. Cytology: 2n = 164 (de Lange et al. 2004). This is the same tetraploid number as that reported by Brownlie (in Fabbri 1963) for the species in New Caledonia, but different to the diploid count of n = 41 reported in Australia (Tindale & Roy 2002). Notes: Fraser-Jenkins et al. (2018) noted that “Although the name has long been applied to various Indian and Asian species … the true A. aristata from Tahiti etc. is a different species with smaller, stiffer segments and a less markedly longer lowest basiscopic pinnule of the lowest pinna. The reports from India, Bhutan and mainland Asia, and also from South Africa, refer to other species …”. This observation has been confirmed by Lu et al. (2019), who found the two groups to be resolved in different clades. Fig. 2 : Arachniodes aristata . Mature plants with 3-pinnate fronds growing in forest.Fig. 3 : Arachniodes aristata .

Pterid. 86 (1836) Type taxon: Cyrtomium falcatum (L.f.) C.Presl Etymology: From the Greek cyrtos (arched), a reference to the arched nature of the fronds. Terrestrial ferns, evergreen. Rhizomes erect, scaly. Rhizome scales non-clathrate, ovate or broadly ovate, margins entire or toothed, attached at base, concolorous or bicolorous, pale brown to blackish- brown. Fronds monomorphic, not bulbiferous. Stipes and rachises scaly, adaxially sulcate. Laminae 1 ‑pinnate, coriaceous, scaly. Veins reticulate with free included veinlets. Sori round, borne on abaxial surface, away from the margins, in 1 to several rows either side of midrib; indusia round, peltate. Spores monolete; perispores tuberculate or reticulate, smooth on the surface. Taxonomy: A genus of 35 species included in subfamily Dryopteridoideae (PPG 1 2016). Cyrtomium is assumed to be monophyletic and sister to Polystichum . The polystichoid ferns are sister to the dryopteroid ferns, comprising Arachniodes and Dryopteris (Liu et al. 2016). Only one naturalised species, Cyrtomium falcatum , occurs in New Zealand, first recorded by Brownsey (1981). Distribution: Cyrtomium is a genus of warm temperate regions in the Old World. The greatest diversity is in south-west China, with a few species extending to southern Africa, southern India, and Japan; 31 species in China (Zhang & Barrington 2013a), one native species in Africa and Madagascar (Roux 2009), and one native species in Hawai‘i (Palmer 2003); one widespread naturalised species in North America, Europe, southern Africa, Reunion, Hawai‘i, Australia and New Zealand. Biostatus: Exotic; fully naturalised. Table 3 : Number of species in New Zealand within Cyrtomium C.Presl Category Number Exotic: Fully Naturalised 1 Total 1 Recognition: In New Zealand the sole species of Cyrtomium can be recognised by its terrestrial habit, erect rhizome, 1-pinnate scaly frond, reticulate venation, and sori protected by round indusia that are arranged in several rows either side of the midrib.

Recognition: Lastreopsis hispida is recognised by its long-creeping rhizomes, stipes and rachises that are densely covered in black bristle-like scales, harsh 3–5-pinnate laminae, sharply acute ultimate lamina segments, and round sori protected by reniform indusia with yellow clavate glands on the margins and surfaces.

Lastreopsis velutina (A.Rich.),,240-960mm-long,"Lastreopis velutina occurs in drier broadleaved, podocarp, beech, kānuka and coastal forest, and under mānuka scrub. It is found on the forest floor, on well-drained hillsides, rocky slopes, stony ground, clay banks, dry creek banks, alluvial terraces, amongst tree roots, and sometimes on stream banks. It grows on greywacke, limestone and volcanic substrates. Recognition: Lastreopsis velutina is recognised by its erect rhizomes, 3–4-pinnate laminae which have a distinctive velvety feel due to the dense covering of soft red-brown acicular hairs on all surfaces and margins, and small reniform indusia with yellow clavate glands on the margins and surfaces. The very broad laminae and elongated basal basiscopic secondary pinnae on the proximal pair of primary pinnae are also characteristic. Cytology: n = 41 (Brownlie 1958 – as Ctenitis velutina ). Notes: Brownsey et al. (2019) demonstrated that Colenso’s Nephrodium pentangulare was based on a specimen of Lastreopsis velutina , and it is included here under the synonymy for that species. However, Nephrodium pentangulare was misinterpreted by Cheeseman (1906, 1925), Allan (1961) and Tindale (1965) and included in what is now known as Parapolystichum microsorum . Tindale incorrectly used it as the basis for the new combination Lastreopsis microsora subsp. pentangularis , by which name it has since been known in New Zealand (e.g. Brownsey et al. 1985) .

Ching, Sunyatsenia 5: 239 (1940) Type taxon: Parapolystichum effusum (Sw.) Ching Etymology: From the genus Polystichum , and the Greek para- (near), a reference to the similarity between the two genera. Terrestrial (NZ) or rarely epiphytic ferns (not NZ). Rhizomes erect to long-creeping, scaly. Rhizome scales non-clathrate, linear to ovate, margins entire (NZ) or rarely toothed (not NZ), attached at base, concolorous, pale brown to almost black. Fronds monomorphic, occasionally bulbiferous (not NZ). Stipes and rachises scaly, hairy, adaxially sulcate. Laminae 3–4-pinnate (NZ), or 2– or 5-pinnate (not NZ), anadromous or catadromous, herbaceous, scaly, hairy and usually with unicellular glands. Hairs usually short and catenate. Veins free. Sori round, borne on abaxial surface, away from the margin, in 1 row either side of midrib; indusia reniform, peltate, or absent. Spores monolete; perispores rugose, tuberculate or echinate, sometimes minutely echinate on the surface. Taxonomy: A genus of c. 31 species (Gardner et al. 2017), included in the subfamily Elaphoglossoideae (PPG 1 2016). Species of Parapolystichum were previously included in the genus Lastreopsis , which was revised by Tindale (1965). She recognised a total of 33 species, of which 17 occurred in Australia alone (Green 1994; Jones 1998). However, the genus has since been identified as paraphyletic, and subsequently split into two, with 18 species retained in a monophyletic Lastreopsis , 31 recognised in Parapolystichum , and four still incertae sedis (Labiak et al. 2014, 2015a; Gardner et al. 2017). 34However, Labiak et al. (2014, 2015a) were unable to find any morphological characters to distinguish Parapolystichum from Lastreopsis . Allan (1961) initially treated Parapolystichum glabellum and P. microsorum subsp. pentagulare as Ctenitis glabella and C. decomposita , but, following Tindale (1957), he accepted both in Lastreopsis (Allan 1961, Supplementary Notes). New combinations in Parapolystichum were made by Labiak et al. (2015a). Tindale (1965) noted an imperfectly known taxon from the Kermadec Islands, which was subsequently described as Lastreopsis kermadecensis by Perrie & Brownsey (2012), and transferred to Parapolystichum by Gardner et al. (2017). 1 Rhizomes long-creeping, with fronds arising at intervals; fronds bearing whitish catenate hairs around the stipes and rachises, and on both lamina surfaces; abaxial rachis surface densely hairy ...................................................... microsorum Rhizomes erect or short-creeping, with fronds clustered at the apex; fronds bearing reddish catenate hairs, mainly along the adaxial groove of the rachis, and on the adaxial surfaces; abaxial rachis surface sparsely hairy or glabrous ......................................................................................................................2 2 Secondary pinnae narrow, 10–90 mm long, 3–35 mm wide; hairs on adaxial costae up to 0.7 mm long; plants of main islands of New Zealand .............. glabellum Secondary pinnae wider, 35–150 mm long, 11–45 mm wide; hairs on adaxial costae up to 0.3 mm long; plants confined to Kermadec Islands .......... kermadecense Distribution: Parapolystichum extends from the Neotropics to Africa, Madagascar, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand and the south Pacific, with the centre of diversity in Australia; five species in the Neotropics, six in Africa, nine in Madagascar, one in Indonesia, one in Papua New Guinea, nine in Australia, one in New Caledonia and one in the Pacific (Tindale 1965; Labiak et al. 2014, 2015a; Gardner et al. 2017).

Ching Category Number Indigenous (Endemic) 2 Indigenous (Non-endemic) 1 Total 3 Recognition: Currently no morphological characters are known that consistently distinguish Parapolystichum from Lastreopsis , and the two genera cannot always be recognised as such in the field. In the Australasian region, species of Parapolystichum generally have erect to long-creeping rhizomes, laminae that are 2–4-pinnate and anadromous in the distal half, and sori that may be indusiate or exindusiate. They have short, catenate (ctenitoid) hairs on the lamina and rachis surfaces, rather than long, acicular or clavate hairs. By contrast, species of Lastreopsis subg. Lastreopsis generally have short- to long-creeping rhizomes (although not in L. velutina ), laminae that are 3–5 ‑pinnate and catadromous in the distal half, and sori that are more frequently indusiate. They generally have long, acicular or clavate hairs on the lamina and rachis surfaces.

Parapolystichum glabellum (A.Cunn.),,120-900mm-long,"Parapolystichum glabellum occurs in wetter kauri, podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, under mānuka and kānuka, in coastal forest, and rarely under Pinus and Cupressus macrocarpa . It is a terrestrial fern found on the forest floor, in damp gullies, on streambanks, river terraces, tracksides, bush margins, in boggy ground, and amongst rocks and boulders. It grows on greywacke, limestone and acidic volcanic substrates. Recognition: Parapolystichum glabellum is characterised by its erect rhizome, 2–3-pinnate-pinnatifid laminae, reddish catenate hairs in the sulcus and on the adaxial costae, and only scattered hairs on the abaxial surface. It is distinguished from P. microsorum by its erect rather than creeping rhizome, and reddish hairs, which are largely confined to the adaxial surface, rather than whitish hairs, which occur on both surfaces. It is very similar to Parapolystichum kermadecense but generally has a more divided frond, shorter and narrower secondary pinnae (10–90 cf. 35–150 mm long, 3–35 cf. 11–45 mm wide), more abundant hairs, and more frequent and conspicuous glands.

Parapolystichum kermadecense (Perrie & Brownsey),,370-910mm-long,"Parapolystichum kermadecense is a terrestrial fern found in the wet forest of Raoul Island, where it occurs above c. 125 m, particularly under Rhopalostylis baueri and Metrosideros kermadecensis . Recognition: Parapolystichum kermadecense is endemic to the Kermadec Islands, and the only species of Parapolystichum or Lastreopsis found there. It is distinguished by its erect to prostrate rhizome, 2-pinnate-pinnatifid to 3 ‑pinnate laminae, reddish catenate hairs largely confined to the sulcus and adaxial costae, and only scattered hairs present on the abaxial surfaces. Within New Zealand it is most similar to Parapolystichum glabellum , which generally has a more divided frond, narrower secondary pinnae (10–90 cf. 35–150 mm long, 3–35 cf. 11–45 mm wide), longer and more abundant hairs, and more frequent and conspicuous glands.

Parapolystichum microsorum (Endl.),,240-960mm-long,"Parapolystichum microsorum occurs in podocarp, broadleaved and coastal forest, under kānuka, and rarely under willows. It is a terrestrial fern found on the forest floor, on streambanks, on river terraces, near waterfalls, in damp gullies, amongst rocks, on clay banks, and on tracksides. It grows on greywacke, limestone and acidic volcanic substrates. Recognition: Parapolystichum microsorum is characterised by a long-creeping rhizome, 3–4-pinnate laminae, and abundant whitish catenate hairs on both lamina surfaces. It is distinguished from P. glabellum by its creeping rather than erect rhizome, and whitish hairs on both lamina surfaces, rather than reddish hairs, which are largely confined to the adaxial surface. The abaxial rachis surface is densely hairy, unlike those in P. glabellum and P. kermadecense , which are glabrous or only sparsely hairy. Parapolystichum microsorum in New Zealand is very similar to the plant that occurs in Australia. However, Tindale (1965) distinguished them as separate subspecies, with subsp. microsorum occurring in Australia and subsp. pentangulare (Colenso) Tindale confined to New Zealand. Subsp. pentangulare was said to have smaller laminae (140–400 mm long, 90–320 mm wide) compared to subsp. microsorum (180–500 mm long, 120–470 mm wide), with the ultimate segments more sharply spinulose-dentate (Tindale 1965). The recognition of two subspecies was described as “somewhat borderline” by Tindale (1965), but there is a difference in chromosome number, Australian plants being diploid and New Zealand plants tetraploid. The status of the species in both countries needs further investigation. Cytology: In New Zealand Parapolystichum microsorum has been reported as tetraploid with n = 82 (Brownlie 1961– as Ctenitis decomposita ). In Australia it has been reported as diploid with n = 41 (Tindale & Roy 2002). Notes: The name Nephrodium decompositum R.Br., and combinations based on it, used in earlier Flora treatments are misidentifications of Lastreopsis decomposita (R.Br.) Tindale, which is a diploid Australian species. The name Parapolystichum microsorum subsp. pentangulare , and earlier combinations based on the same type, cannot be used for the New Zealand plant because Colenso’s original collection is a specimen of Lastreopsis velutina (Brownsey et al. 2019). Plants in Australia and New Zealand need further investigation to see if there are consistent differences between them, and whether diploid and tetraploid forms are each confined to one or other country. If New Zealand plants deserve recognition, the varietal name Nephrodium decompositum var. pubescens is available. Fig. 97 : Parapolystichum microsorum .

Bor.-Amer. 2, 226 (1803) Type taxon: Polystichum lonchitis (L.) Roth. Etymology: From the Greek poly- (many), and stichos (a row), alluding to the arrangement of the sori in several rows in some species. Vernacular name: shield fern Terrestrial ferns, evergreen or occasionally marcescent. Rhizomes erect, scaly. Rhizome scales non- clathrate, ovate or narrowly ovate, margins entire or fimbriate, attached at base, concolorous or bicolorous, pale brown to black-brown. Fronds monomorphic, sometimes bulbiferous. Stipes and rachises scaly, adaxially sulcate. Laminae 1–3-pinnate (NZ), or 4-pinnnate (not NZ), herbaceous or coriaceous, scaly. Veins free. Sori round, borne on abaxial surface, away from the margin, in 1 row either side of midrib; indusia round, peltate. Spores monolete; perispores tuberculate or cristate, often reticulate or fenestrate, rarely minutely echinate on the surface. Taxonomy: A genus of c. 500 species included in the subfamily Dryopteridoideae (PPG 1 2016). Polystichum is considered to be monophyletic (Le Péchon et al. 2016) and sister to Cyrtomium . The polystichoid ferns are sister to the dryopteroid ferns, the latter comprising Arachniodes and Dryopteris (Liu et al. 2016). Allan (1961) recognised four indigenous species in New Zealand – P. cystostegia , P. richardii , P. sylvaticum (as silvaticum ) and P. vestitum . However, Perrie et al. (2003a) showed that plants previously referred to P. richardii comprised an allo-octoploid complex with two tetraploid species, P. oculatum and P. wawranum , and an octoploid species, P. neozelandicum . Two naturalised species, P. proliferum and P. setiferum , and one casual species , P. lentum , were recorded by Brownsey (1981). A second casual species, P. polyblepharum , was reported by Heenan et al. (2004). 1 Fronds bearing bulbils ..............................................................................................................2 Fronds lacking bulbils ..............................................................................................................4 2 Fronds with numerous bulbils, borne along the rachis at junctions with the primary pinnae ............................................................................................................ setiferum Fronds with one or a few bulbils, borne near the apex of the rachis ...........................3 3 Proximal primary pinnae bearing several stalked secondary pinnae ........................ proliferum Proximal primary pinnae sometimes divided to the costa, but never bearing more than one stalked secondary pinna ............................................................ lentum 4 Indusia with conspicuous black centres, or, if only tiny dark centres, scales at stipe/rachis junction with colourless, fimbriate margins at their bases ......................5 Indusia uniformly pale brown, or absent; scales at stipe/rachis junction with entire or ciliate margins ....................................................................................................7 5 Scales at stipe/rachis junction appearing hair-like to the naked eye (<130 μm wide); indusia often lacking an obvious dark centre ................................ wawranum Scales at stipe/rachis junction obviously scale-like to the naked eye (>130 μm wide); indusia always with an obvious dark centre ..........................................6 6 Scales at stipe/rachis junction ovate or broadly ovate, >750 μm wide (and usually >1000 μm wide); spores 36–48 μm long, 27–36 μm wide .............................. oculatum Scales at stipe/rachis junction ovate or narrowly ovate, <650 μm wide; spores 46–58 μm long, 36–45 μm wide ............................................................ neozelandicum 7 Scales at stipe/rachis junction concolorous ..............................................................................8 Scales at stipe/rachis junction bicolorous, with shiny dark centres and pale margins ............................................................................................................................9 448 Stipe and rachis scales entire; indusia markedly convex; plants of alpine regions .................................................................................................................... cystostegia Stipe and rachis scales irregularly toothed; indusia ± flat; naturalised plants of urban areas ........................................................................................ polyblepharum 9 Indusia absent; costae of primary pinnae with narrow wings .................................. sylvaticum Indusia present; costae of primary pinnae lacking wings ............................................ vestitum Distribution: Polystichum is widespread in north and south temperate regions, and in montane to alpine regions of the warm temperate and tropical zones. The centres of diversity are in southern Asia, and in Central and South America (Zhang & Barrington 2013a); 208 species in China (Zhang & Barrington 2013a), 22 in Africa and Indian Ocean islands (Roux 2009), four in Australia (Jones 1998), perhaps five in the south Pacific, and three in Hawai‘i (Palmer 2003). Ten species in New Zealand; five endemic, one indigenous, and four naturalised or casual. Biostatus: Indigenous (Non-endemic). Table 7 : Number of species in New Zealand within Polystichum Roth Category Number Indigenous (Endemic) 5 Indigenous (Non-endemic) 1 Exotic: Fully Naturalised 2 Exotic: Casual 2 Total 10 Recognition: In New Zealand, species of Polystichum are recognised by their terrestrial habit, erect rhizomes, 1–3-pinnate fronds, abundant and sometimes bicolorous scales, and round sori protected by round indusia. Three naturalised species are bulbiferous, unlike any other species of Dryopteridaceae in New Zealand. The spores are tuberculate or cristate, often with complex fenestration and reticulation (Large & Braggins 1991). Cytology: The base chromosome number in Polystichum is x = 41 (Kramer 1990). Hybridisation: Hybridisation is common amongst the indigenous species of Polystichum in New Zealand. Seven different combinations were recorded by Perrie et al. (2003a, 2003b). Plants of hybrid origin can be identified by their abnormally formed spores, but determining parentage depends on morphology and field observations of what species were growing in the immediate vicinity of the putative hybrid.",0.5-1.3mm,120-400mm-long; 90-320mm-wide; 140-400mm-long; 90-320mm-wide,0.4mm-long; 0.5mm-long,,,,,,100-560mm-long,Dryopteridaceae,"['indigenous', 'non-endemic']"
Polystichum cystostegia (Hook.),,40-440mm-long; 550mm-long,"Polystichum cystostegia occurs in alpine and subalpine herbfield, tussock grassland, flushes, dry creek beds, rock crevices, among boulders, on rock faces, and among shingle slips in alpine areas, rarely extending into forest at the treeline. It is one of the few truly alpine ferns in New Zealand and occurs at higher altitudes than most other New Zealand pteridophytes. Recognition: Polystichum cystostegia is distinguished from all other species in New Zealand by its alpine habitat, large inflated indusia, concolorous orange-brown stipe and rhizome scales, and lack of bulbils. The species is likely to be confused only with P. vestitum , which has bicolorous scales and lacks inflated indusia. Cytology: n = 82 (Brownlie 1958). Hybridisation: There is evidence that Polystichum cystostegia hybridises with P. vestitum (Perrie et al. 2003b​​​​). Notes: The name Polystichum cystostegia has sometimes been altered to P. cystostegium or even P. cystostigium (e.g. Armstrong 1881), but in the original description Hooker (1862b) treated the specific epithet as a noun in apposition (Art. 23.1), indicated by his spelling of Cystostegia with a capital letter. His original spelling should therefore be retained. Fig. 106 : Polystichum cystostegia . Mature 2- pinnate-pinnatifid fronds.Fig. 107 : Polystichum cystostegia .

"Polystichum neozelandicum Fée, Mém. Foug., 8. Descr. Esp. Nouv. 99 (1857)",,140-1000mm-long,"Polystichum neozelandicum occurs in coastal, broadleaved, podocarp and beech forest, under mānuka and kānuka scrub, under conifer plantations and willows, and in 49regenerating bush, reverting pasture and among flax, usually in drier, well-lit conditions. It grows on coastal rocks and cliffs, hillsides, road cuttings, clay banks, river banks, alluvial terraces, tracksides, among rocks and tree roots, on rotting logs, and on the forest floor. It is found on greywacke, mudstone, scoria, limestone and sandy substrates. Recognition: Polystichum neozelandicum is distinguished by the scales at the stipe/rachis junction, which are narrowly ovate, blackish-brown, ciliate on the margins and sparsely fimbriate at their bases (Perrie et al. 2003a, fig. 5). The indusia have a conspicuous black centre ( ibid., fig. 6). The laminae are dark green on the adaxial surfaces and paler green abaxially. It is likely to be confused only with P. oculatum , which has broader scales (135–570 μm wide, cf. 770–2280 μm wide) and smaller spores (36–48 μm long, 27–36 μm wide, cf. 46–58 μm long, 36–45 μm wide). Further, while the primary costae and lamina are concolorous on the abaxial surface in P. oculatum , the primary costae are usually darker in P. neozelandicum (concolorous exceptions being mostly confined to Otago). Polystichum neozelandicum is distinguished from most of the naturalised species by its lack of bulbils, from P. vestitum and P. sylvaticum by its concolorous rather than bicolorous scales at the stipe/rachis junction, from P. cystostegia by its flat rather than inflated indusia, and from P. wawranum by its broader scales and indusia with prominent dark centres . P. neozelandicum can also be distinguished by having stalked secondary pinnae only in the proximal half of the primary pinnae, whereas P. vestitum and P. sylvaticum have stalked secondary pinnae extending into the distal half of the primary pinnae. Cytology: n = c. 164 (Perrie et al. 2003a). Hybridisation: There is evidence that Polystichum neozelandicum hybridises with P. oculatum and P. wawranum (Perrie et al. 2003a), and with P. vestitum (Perrie et al. 2003a, 2003b). Notes: Perrie et al. (2003a) recognised two subspecies within Polystichum neozelandicum – subsp. neozelandicum from Te Paki to Kāwhia and the Bay of Plenty, and subsp. zerophyllum from Taupō south to Stewart Island. AFLP DNA-fingerprinting analysis of populations of P. neozelandicum showed low genetic variation within each subspecies, but significant variation between them, suggesting quite different evolutionary lineages for the two groups. Perrie et al. (2003a) were unable to determine whether the two lineages represented two independent allopolyploid origins, or a single allopolyploid origin with subsequent divergence. However, despite the clear genetic distinction, Perrie et al. (2003a) found only slight morphological differences between the two groups. In particular, the dark central area of the indusia was larger in subsp. neozelandicum than in subsp. zerophyllum (15–60% cf. 5–30% of the surface area – see Perrie et al. 2003a, fig. 6). However, in practice the two groups were distinguished more readily by their geographical distribution (Perrie et al. 2003a, fig. 1). The two subspecies are not recognised here to be consistent with the treatment of other polyploids containing multiple lineages, such as Asplenium gracillimum (Brownsey & Perrie 2018). The name Polystichum aristatum C.Presl, as used by Hooker (1854–1855), and combinations based on it, are misidentifications. An abnormal form of P. neozelandicum with very short pinnae, collected on Kāpiti Island by A. Wilkinson, was identified as P. mohrioides (Bory) C.Presl (Allan 1961). Plants of P. cystostegia from the Auckland Islands and Campbell Island were also referred to this species by Kirk (1882). However, P. mohrioides was listed as erroneously reported for New Zealand by Brownsey et al. (1985). Fig. 116 : Polystichum neozelandicum .

Polystichum oculatum (Hook.),,125-780mm-long,"Polystichum oculatum occurs in drier coastal, broadleaved, podocarp and beech forest, under mānuka and kānuka, in pine plantations, on forest margins, and in grassland. It grows on coastal cliffs, hillsides, roadside banks, in rocky gullies, among boulders, on scree, and on river banks. It is found on greywacke, basalt, limestone and marble substrates. Recognition: Polystichum oculatum is distinguished by the scales at the stipe/rachis junction, which are broad, blackish-brown or irregularly bicolorous, ciliate on the margins and sparsely fimbriate at their bases (Perrie et al. 2003a, fig. 5). The indusia have a conspicuous black centre ( ibid., fig. 6). The laminae are blue-green on the adaxial surfaces and paler green abaxially. It is likely to confused only with P. neozelandicum , which has narrower scales (135–570 μm wide, cf. 770–2280 μm wide), and larger spores (46–58 μm long, 36–45 μm wide, cf. 36–48 μm long, 27–36 μm wide). Further, while the primary costae and lamina are concolorous on the adaxial surface in P. oculatum , the primary costae are usually darker in P. neozelandicum (concolorous exceptions being mostly confined to Otago). Polystichum oculatum is distinguished from most of the naturalised species by its lack of bulbils, from P. vestitum and P. sylvaticum by its usually concolorous rather than bicolorous scales at the stipe/rachis junction, from P. cystostegia by its flat rather than inflated indusia, and from P. wawranum by its much broader scales and indusia with dark centres . Cytology: n = 82 (Brownlie 1958 – as Polystichum richardii ; Perrie et al. 2003a). Hybridisation: There is evidence that Polystichum oculatum hybridises with P. neozelandicum and P. vestitum (Perrie et al. 2003a). 52Fig. 123 : Polystichum oculatum .

"Polystichum sylvaticum Diels in Engler & Prantl, Nat. Pflanzenfam. 1(4)",,150-800mm-long,"Polystichum sylvaticum occurs in damp, dark, podocarp and broadleaved forest. It grows on hillsides, clay banks, tracksides, river banks, alluvial terraces, damp rock faces, and in wet gullies and seepages. Recognition: Polystichum sylvaticum is distinguished by the scales at the stipe/rachis junction, many of which are markedly bicolorous, with dark centres and pale margins. Indusia are absent, and the sori are protected only by a few small scales. The laminae are elliptic, dark green on the adaxial surface, and the primary costae are narrowly winged throughout their length except in the largest fronds. The species is likely to be confused only with P. vestitum , which also has bicolorous scales, but has well-formed indusia, and narrow wings on the primary costae only at their distal end. Its laminae are relatively long and narrow with ± parallel sides, and dark shiny green on the adaxial surface. P. sylvaticum is distinguished from most of the naturalised species by its lack of bulbils, and is clearly distinct from P. cystostegia , which has inflated indusia and is largely confined to alpine areas. Cytology: n = c. 82 (Brownsey in Dawson et al. 2000). Hybridisation: There is evidence that Polystichum sylvaticum hybridises with P. vestitum (Perrie et al. 2003b). Notes: The name Polypodium sylvaticum, as described by Colenso (1845), is illegitimate (Art. 6.4), being a later homonym of P. sylvaticum Schkuhr (1809). Diels (in Engler & Prantl 1898–1902) intended to create a new combination in Polystichum by writing “ P. silvaticum (Colenso als Polypodium ) Diels”. However, Diels’s name is a new name (Art. 6.12a, 6.14), validated by Colenso’s description of Polypodium sylvaticum . Diels was obligated to adopt Colenso’s epithet with the original spelling (Art. 60.1, 60.2), unless he explicitly changed the spelling and stated that he was making a correction; but there is no evidence of such intent. The correct name and spelling for this species is Polystichum sylvaticum Diels in Engler & Prantl, Nat. Pflanzenfam. 1(4): 192, 1899 (‘ silvaticum’) , not P. silvaticum (Colenso) Diels.

Polystichum vestitum (G.Forst.),,220-1700mm-long; 2250mm-long,"Polystichum vestitum occurs in broadleaved, podocarp, beech, and coastal Olearia , Dracophyllum and Metrosideros umbellata forest, under mānuka and kānuka, amongst flax, under introduced conifers and willows, in bracken and other scrub, in open grassland, and in subalpine tussock and herbfield. It grows on the forest floor, on bush margins, at the base of cliffs, on roadside banks, on river banks, in swamp forest, on boggy ground, and on coastal cliffs. It is found on a variety of substrates including greywacke, mudstone, limestone, andesite, volcanic ash and pumice, scoria, and schist. Recognition: Polystichum vestitum is distinguished by the scales at the stipe/rachis junction, which are usually markedly bicolorous, with dark centres and pale margins (Perrie et al. 2003b, fig. 2). The indusia are flat and concolorous, lacking dark centres. The laminae are relatively long and narrow with ± parallel sides, dark shiny green on the adaxial surface, and paler green on the abaxial surface. The species is likely to be confused only with P. sylvaticum , which also has bicolorous scales, but lacks indusia and has narrow wings along the length of the primary costae, or with P. cystostegia , which has inflated indusia and is largely confined to alpine areas. It is distinguished from most of the naturalised species by its lack of bulbils. Some plants from the Chatham Islands, islands off Stewart Island, and subantarctic islands, particularly the Snares Islands, have larger and wider fronds with longer primary pinnae (see measurements in square brackets in the description). Bicolorous scales are very scattered on the stipe and rachis, and most of the scales are uniformly pale brown, and often fimbriate on the margins. Several authors (e.g. Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth 2000; de Lange et al. 2011) have suggested that these plants may belong to a different species, but analysis of morphological and AFLP DNA fingerprinting data by Perrie et al. (2003b) provided no strong evidence that they constitute an evolutionary lineage distinct from mainland plants. They are treated here as part of P. vestitum but need further investigation. Cytology: n = 82 (Brownlie 1954). Hybridisation: There is evidence that Polystichum vestitum hybridises with P. neozelandicum , P. oculatum and P. wawranum (Perrie et al. 2003a), and with P. cystostegia and P. sylvaticum (Perrie et al. 2003b). Notes: Nicolson & Fosberg (2003) designated a lectotype for Polypodium vestitum (BM 001048431) almost contemporaneously with Perrie et al. (2003b), who chose a different Forster collection (BM – photo WELT neg. no. B13608). It transpires that Nicolson & Fosberg’s book was published in the first week of December 2003 (Koelz, pers. comm., 20 Sept. 2018) whereas the paper by Perrie et al. was published on 10 December 2003, about a week later (see New Zealand Journal of Botany 42, Number 1, title page, 2004). Nicolson & Fosberg’s designation of the lectotype therefore takes precedence. The names Aspidium proliferum R.Br. and Aspidium aculeatum Sw. used in earlier Flora treatments are misidentifications of Polystichum vestitum. 63Fig. 154 : Polystichum vestitum .

Polystichum wawranum (Szyszyl.),,275-1270mm-long,"Polystichum wawranum occurs in kauri, podocarp, broadleaved, beech and coastal forest, under mānuka and kānuka, amongst flax and coastal scrub, and on grassy slopes, usually in drier and more open conditions. It is found on coastal cliffs, hillsides, tracksides, roadside banks, streambanks and river terraces, in gullies, and on the forest floor. It grows on greywacke and limestone substrates. Recognition: Polystichum wawranum is distinguished by the scales at the stipe/rachis junction that are very narrow, blackish-brown, hair-like and abundantly fimbriate at their bases (Perrie et al. 2003a​​​​​​, fig. 5). The indusia are either concolorous or have tiny black centres ( ibid., fig. 6). The laminae are olive- to blue-green on the adaxial surfaces and paler green abaxially. P. wawranum is likely to be confused only with P. neozelandicum , which has wider scales (40–120 μm wide, cf. 135–570 μm wide), indusia with larger dark centres, and larger spores (40–48 μm long, 29–36 μm wide, cf. 46–58 μm long, 36–45 μm wide). Polystichum wawranum is distinguished from most of the naturalised species by its lack of bulbils, from P. vestitum and P. sylvaticum by its concolorous rather than bicolorous scales at the stipe/rachis junction, from P. cystostegia by its flat rather than inflated indusia, and from P. oculatum by its much narrower scales . Cytology: n = c. 82 (Perrie et al. 2003a). Hybridisation: There is evidence that P. wawranum hybridises with P. neozelandicum and P. vestitum (Perrie et al. 2003a). Fig. 163 : Polystichum wawranum .

Sci. 3: 290, t. 12, f. 1 (1819) Type taxon: Rumohra aspidioides Raddi Etymology: Named in honour of Karl von Rumohr Holstein (1785–1843), a German patron of the arts and sciences. Terrestrial or epiphytic, evergreen ferns. Rhizomes long-creeping or climbing, scaly. Rhizome scales non-clathrate, ovate or narrowly ovate, margins entire or minutely toothed, attached at base or peltate, concolorous, pale to dark brown. Fronds monomorphic, not bulbiferous. Stipes and rachises scaly, adaxially sulcate. Laminae 2–3-pinnate, coriaceous, scaly. Veins free. Sori round, borne on abaxial surface, away from the margin, in 1 row either side of midrib; indusia round, peltate. Spores monolete; perispores coarsely rugose or tuberculate, smooth on the surface. Taxonomy: A genus of seven species included in the subfamily Elaphoglossoideae (Bauret et al. 2017). Rumohra is considered to be monophyletic, and sister to Megalastrum , with the two genera together sister to Lastreopsis sens. str. (Labiak et al. 2014). Only one widespread species, Rumohra adiantiformis , is present in New Zealand. Distribution: Rumohra is a small genus of seven species, with three endemic to Madagascar, one to Juan Fernandez Island, and two to Brazil. One species is widespread in tropical and south temperate 67regions from South and Central America to Africa, Madagascar, Australasia, New Guinea and the South Pacific (Sundue et al. 2013; Labiak et al. 2014; Bauret et al. 2017). One non-endemic species in New Zealand. Biostatus: Indigenous (Non-endemic). Table 8 : Number of species in New Zealand within Rumohra Raddi Category Number Indigenous (Non-endemic) 1 Total 1 Recognition: In New Zealand, the sole species of Rumohra is distinguished by its terrestrial or climbing habit, long-creeping rhizomes, 2–3-pinnate scaly fronds, and round sori protected by round indusia. The spores are coarsely rugose or tuberculate, and smooth on the surface (Large & Braggins 1991). Cytology: The base chromosome number in Rumohra is x = 41 (Kramer 1990).",0.7-1.5mm,150-730mm-long; 60-330mm-wide,40-120μm-wide,,,,40-48μm-long; 29-36μm-wide; 40-48μm-long; 29-36μm-wide,,105-700mm-long,Dryopteridaceae,"['indigenous', 'endemic']"
Rumohra adiantiformis (G.Forst.),,85-1020mm-long,"Rumohra adiantiformis occurs in kauri, podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, in kānuka and coastal scrub, under Pinus radiata , among flax and bracken, and rarely in dune hollows and on swamp margins amongst rushes. It is usually a climbing epiphyte, but also grows on fallen logs, and on the ground amongst roots and boulders, at the base of tree trunks, in gullies, on rock faces, and on forest margins. It has been recorded growing epiphytically on Cyathea dealbata , C. smithii , Dicksonia fibrosa and D. squarrosa . Recognition: Rumohra adiantiformis is recognised by its terrestrial or climbing habit, long-creeping rhizomes densely covered in conspicuous chestnut-brown scales, 2–3-pinnate laminae bearing scales and tiny red or yellow glands on the abaxial surface, and conspicuous round sori protected by round indusia with dark centres. Cytology: n = 41 (Brownlie 1958). Notes: Mazumdar et al. (2019) lectotypified Polypodium adianthoides Burm.f. with a specimen in G ‑PREL collected by Pryon in Indonesia. The collection is a specimen of Rumohra adiantiformis (Mazumdar 2019, fig. 4) and hence Polypodium adianthoides (Burmann 1768) predates P. adiantiforme (Forster 1786), the basionym of Rumohra adiantiformis. In order to avoid an unfortunate nomenclatural change to a well-known and widespread fern, Mazumdar (2019) has proposed conserving Forster’s name over Burman’s. The names Polypodium coriaceum Sw. and Aspidium capense Willd., and combinations based on them, were used in earlier New Zealand Floras but are currently regarded as synonyms of Rumohra adiantiformis , with types from Jamaica and South Africa, respectively. Bauret et al. (2017) showed that Rumohra adiantiformis from across its geographical range was “grossly polyphyletic”. They recognised six geographically structured and supported lineages in the Neotropics, southern South America, South Africa, the Comoros, the Western Indian Ocean islands (Madagascar, Mascarenes and Seychelles), and Australasia (Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea). However, they found no distinctive morphological characters to distinguish these lineages, and, until further in-depth investigation is undertaken, recognised them as cryptic species within Rumohra adiantiformis . The type of R. adiantiformis was collected in New Zealand and, even if six different species are subsequently recognised, the name will continue to apply to the Australasian lineage. However, the basionyms Polypodium coriaceum and Aspidium capense probably relate to other lineages. 69Fig. 170 : Rumohra adiantiformis .

Dicranopteris linearis (Burm.f.),,140-1220mm-long,"Dicranopteris linearis is confined in New Zealand to geothermal areas, often around active vents. It often occurs amongst Kunzea scrub, with Nephrolepis flexuosa ,Christella dentata , and/or Gleichenia spp. It can be locally common. Recognition: Dicranopteris linearis is the only species of Dicranopteris in New Zealand. Species of Sticherus are superficially similar but are distinguished by the presence of costal segments on the β costae; Dicranopteris has none. Cytology: 2n = c. 160 (de Lange et al. 2004). This is consistent with tetraploid counts of Dicranopteris linearis from India, Sri Lanka and New Guinea; diploid counts have also been obtained from these other areas (see Löve et al. 1977). Notes: Numerous varieties of Dicranopteris linearis have been recognised elsewhere; 13 in Malesia (Holttum 1959), three in Australia (Chinnock & Bell 1998). The minute glands noted by Chinnock & Bell (1998) on the abaxial surface of the laminae of Australian plants they called Dicranopteris linearis var. linearis also occur in New Zealand plants, as well as material from New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, Cook Islands, French Polynesia, Pitcairn Island, and Hawaiian Islands. In contrast, the Australian lectotype of Gleichenia hermannii R.Br. (= Dicranopteris linearis ) has very few red-brown glands on the abaxial surface of the laminae. Furthermore, the protologue of Brown (1810) states “… pinnis linearibus integerrimis obtusis ,…”. The apices of the ultimate segments of the lectotype are a mixture of obtuse and emarginate, whereas New Zealand material is much more regularly emarginate. WELT P005357 (Rotomahana, E. Craig s.n. ) is unusual in that hairs are abundant over the abaxial surface of the lamina and the minute glands are absent or obscured. It thus resembles other taxa, such as D. caudata (Copel.) H.St.John from Fiji. Satisfactory measurements of spore size could not be obtained from New Zealand material in AK, CHR, or WELT; normal spore development may be uncommon in New Zealand. However, the few spores observed are considerably smaller than those of Gleichenia , consistent with the findings of Large & Braggins (1991). Bartholomew et al. (1997) pointed out that Carl Thunberg’s names in Johan Murray’s Systema vegetabilium of 1784 should be attributed to Thunberg. The correct author citation for Polypodium dichotomum is therefore “Thunb.” and not “Thunb. ex Murray”. 6Fig. 8 : Dicranopteris linearis .

Rachis with pinnate lamina (not NZ), or absent with a single pair of pinnae (not NZ), or reduced to a bud at the apex of the stipe with a single pair of pinnae (NZ); rachis buds sometimes extending to produce another tier comprising a rachis terminating in another rachis bud and pair of pinnae. Pinnae unforked, comprising a β costa with ultimate leaflets (occasionally NZ), or forking pseudodichotomously 1 to several times (NZ); buds at bifurcations sometimes extending 1-several times. Laminae, axes, and rachis and pinna buds bearing scales, sometimes hair-like. β costae bearing ultimate leaflets. α costae of the ultimate leaflets arranged pinnately on β costae. Ultimate segments on α costa <3 mm long, ± square or ovate, entire, with simple (and obscured) veins between midvein and margin. Sori superficial or embedded in lamina, one on each ultimate segment, each with 2–5 sporangia. Spores trilete, radially symmetrical, plain or shallowly rugulate. Taxonomy: A genus of at least 12 species. Allan (1961) included species now attributed to Dicranopteris and Sticherus in a broadly-circumscribed Gleichenia . Recent treatments generally accept Dicranopteris and Sticherus as separate genera and a narrowly-circumscribed Gleichenia (Smith et al. 2006; Christenhusz et al. 2011). The nomenclatural history of Gleichenia was detailed by Pichi Sermolli (1972). 1 Sori embedded to more than half their height in conspicuous pits within abaxial surface of laminae; scales on abaxial surface of laminae ± orbicular ................................................................................................................................ inclusisora Sori ±superficial on abaxial surface of laminae; scales on abaxial side of laminae ovate or stellate (with hair-like branches) but not orbicular ............................... 2 92 Scales on abaxial surface of α costae not percurrent (i.e., not extending to its apex); abaxial surface of ultimate segments glabrous .......................................................... 3 Scales on abaxial surface of α costae percurrent (i.e., extending to its apex); abaxial surface of ultimate segments usually with minute, branched, hair-like scales .......... 4 3 Ultimate segments green on abaxial surface, complanate or recurved but not pouched, with at least some apices cuspidate (± triangular); most sori with >2 sporangia; indumentum of abaxial surface of β costae dominated by stellate scales with stiffly patent branches, along with some ovate scales .......... microphylla Ultimate segments white or glaucous on abaxial surface, recurved or pouched, with rounded apices; most or all sori with 2 sporangia; indumentum of abaxial surface of β costae comprising an intergrading mix of ovate scales and stellate scales with patent or curled branches ...................................................... dicarpa Not with either of the above combinations of character states (e.g., ultimate segments with glaucous abaxial surfaces and ± complanate; ultimate segments pouched and indumentum of abaxial surface of β costae dominated by stellate scales with stiffly patent branches) .................................... ×punctulata 4 β costae lacking stellate scales with patent branches, 11–73 mm long, with 4–14 pairs of ultimate leaflets; adaxial surface of ultimate segments strongly convex; pinna buds usually extending, often more than once; pinnae with 0–1 (rarely 2) pseudodichotomous forks (excluding growth from pinna buds) .............. alpina β costae bearing stellate scales with patent branches on abaxial and/or adaxial surfaces (branches curled in Chatham Islands’ plants), 29–230 mm long, with 7–50 pairs of ultimate leaflets; adaxial surface of ultimate segments complanate or weakly convex; pinna buds occasionally extending but rarely more than once; pinnae with 1–4 (rarely 0 or 5) pseudodichotomous forks (excluding growth from pinna buds) .................................. dicarpa Distribution: At least 12 species distributed in the Old World tropics and temperate regions, extending from southern Africa, through south-east Asia to Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia (Perrie et al. 2012); three species in Africa and islands of the western Indian Ocean, four in south-east Asia, six in Australia, one in Solomon Islands, and one in New Caledonia. Four species in New Zealand; one endemic. Biostatus: Indigenous (Non-endemic). Table 3 : Number of species and named hybrids in New Zealand within Gleichenia Sm. Category Number Indigenous (Endemic) 1 Indigenous (Non-endemic) 4 Total 5 Recognition: In New Zealand, the ultimate segments less than 3 mm in length distinguish Gleichenia from Dicranopteris and Sticherus which have ultimate segments at least 5 mm long. Cytology: The base chromosome number in Gleichenia is x = 20 or 22 (Kramer 1990). Notes: In relation to the measurements reported here for the trilete spores of Gleichenia , “length” is the longest of the three distances between the (three visible) corners and the midpoint of their respective opposite face, and “width” is the length of that face. Morphological intermediates occur amongst New Zealand’s Gleichenia , combining character states that would otherwise characterise different species and/or exhibiting intermediate character states. Such plants do not appear to have the abnormally-formed spores that characterise many (but not all) fern hybrids. Nevertheless, these morphologically intermediate plants are treated here as putative hybrids, and they are particularly common between G. dicarpa and G. microphylla (see G. ×punctulata ). 10Fig. 22 : Abaxial surfaces of ultimate leaflets (with α costae).

"Gleichenia alpina R.Br., Prodr. Fl. Nov. Holland., 161 (1810)",,85-1250mm-long,"Gleichenia alpina occurs in subalpine bogs and scrub, and other cold, open habitats. It usually grows in the open, often growing through other vegetation, and rarely extends into forest. It favours wet ground, and is often found with Empodisma . Recognition: Gleichenia alpina is characterised by comparatively short frond axes and the dense orange-brown (becoming pale) scales that obscure the abaxial surface of the lamina. Its strongly pouched ultimate segments mean it can be confused only with G. dicarpa . From that species, G. alpina can be distinguished by: the absence of stellate scales with patent branches on the β costae; the strongly convex adaxial surface of the ultimate segments; only 0–1 (rarely 2) pseudodichotomous forks in the pinnae (excluding growth from pinna buds); the absence of accessory leaflets around the rachis bud; and pinna buds that usually extend, often more than once. In contrast, G. dicarpa has: stellate scales with patent branches (curled in Chatham Islands’ plants) on the abaxial and/or adaxial surfaces of the β costae; complanate or weakly convex adaxial surface of the ultimate segments; 1–4 (rarely 0 or 5) pseudodichotomous forks in the pinnae (excluding growth from pinna buds); usually accessory leaflets around the rachis bud; and pinna buds that extend only occasionally and rarely more than once. Cytology: No count has been made from New Zealand material of Gleichenia alpina , but n = 20 has been reported for Australian material (Tindale & Roy 2002). Hybridisation: Infrequent morphological intermediates between Gleichenia alpina and G. dicarpa suggest this pair may hybridise (e.g., near Blackball, L.R. Perrie 6376 & L.D. Shepherd , WELT P026765; near Jackson Bay, L.R. Perrie 6758 et al. , WELT P026768). A single collection (Denniston, F. Overmars A17 , WELT P026702, P026703) indicates that Gleichenia alpina hybridises rarely with G. inclusisora . Although there are few sori, they are embedded, and there are obvious scales on the abaxial surface of the ultimate segments, reflecting the involvement of G. inclusisora . However, these scales are larger, more ovate, and less-distinctly bicolorous than G. inclusisora , and the ultimate segments are abaxially more pouched, indicating the involvement of G. alpina or G. dicarpa . The large size of the scales suggests the other parent is more likely G. alpina than G. dicarpa ; this is borne out by the hybrid’s chloroplast DNA sequence, which matches G. alpina (L.D. Shepherd unpub.). 13Notes: The status of Gleichenia alpina in New Zealand has long been uncertain (Allan 1961; Brownsey et al. 1985). It was treated as a Tasmanian endemic by Chinnock & Bell (1998). However, New Zealand material matches Tasmanian material both in morphology and genetics (Perrie et al. 2007, 2012). Fig. 30 : Gleichenia alpina . Fronds. Fig. 31 : Gleichenia alpina . Fronds.

"Gleichenia dicarpa R.Br., Prodr. Fl. Nov. Holland., 161 (1810)",,,"Gleichenia dicarpa usually occurs in Leptospermum /Kunzea and other scrub and low forest, or swamps and other open habitats with wet ground, such as pakihi (wet, infertile heaths). It is often on road and track sides, and on poor substrates (e.g., clay, ultrabasic). It infrequently extends into forest (kauri, beech), and to drier ground. Gleichenia dicarpa tends to grow in more open and wetter sites than G. microphylla , but they often co-occur. Recognition: The pouched or recurved ultimate segments with rounded apices and white or glaucous abaxial surfaces, sori mostly with 2 sporangia, and the intergrading mix of ovate and stellate scales on the abaxial surface of the β costae distinguish Gleichenia dicarpa from G. microphylla ; the latter has complanate or recurved ultimate segments, with green abaxial surfaces and at least some apices cuspidate, sori mostly with >2 sporangia, and stellate scales with stiffly patent branches dominating the abaxial surface of the β costae. However, putative hybrids combining the character states of both species and/or with intermediate character states are widespread and fairly common. The larger size of the fronds, pinnae with more than 2 pseudodichotomous forks, and accessory leaflets subtending the rachis buds distinguish most plants of Gleichenia dicarpa from G. alpina ; definitively, G. dicarpa has stellate scales with patent branches (curled in Chatham Islands’ plants) on the β costae whereas G. alpina does not. The superficial sori and mixture of ovate and stellate scales on the abaxial surface of the laminae separates Gleichenia dicarpa from G. inclusisora , which has sori embedded within pits in the lamina and ± orbicular scales. Cytology: n = 20 (Brownlie 1958, as Gleichenia circinata [sic]) Hybridisation: Morphological intermediates between Gleichenia dicarpa and G. microphylla are common (e.g., plants with ± complanate ultimate segments that are glaucous on their abaxial surface). These are potentially hybrids and that is how they are treated here (see Gleichenia ×punctulata ). Most putative hybrids with Gleichenia microphylla involve the morphological form of G. dicarpa that lacks both percurrent scales on the abaxial surface of the α costae and scales on the abaxial surface of the ultimate segments (see Notes below). But plants of G. dicarpa with percurrent scales on the abaxial surface of the α costae and scales on the abaxial surface of the ultimate segments from the northern North Island (see Notes) also seem to hybridise with G. microphylla (e.g., Kawerua, A.E. Wright s.n. , AK 223063; Opua, L.R. Perrie 4814 , WELT P022337). Infrequent morphological intermediates between Gleichenia dicarpa and G. alpina suggest that this pair may also hybridise (e.g., near Blackball, L.R. Perrie 6376 & L.D. Shepherd , WELT P026765; near Haast, L.R. Perrie 6753 et al. , WELT P026768). Notes: As circumscribed here, Gleichenia dicarpa in New Zealand is morphologically and genetically variable. At least four groups can be recognised amongst New Zealand plants, but their distinctiveness needs further examination, and it is unclear which might be treated as separate taxa. A) Plants with percurrent scales on the abaxial surface of the α costae and scales on the abaxial surface of the ultimate segments (e.g., Mount Somers, L.R. Perrie 3941 & L.D. Shepherd , WELT P021161; Pukerau, L.R. Perrie et al. 6296 , WELT P026809; Key Summit, L.R. Perrie 5496 & L.D. Shepherd , WELT P026810). Groups C and D share these characteristics, but plants of group A are distinguished by the prominent, patently-branched stellate scales on the abaxial and adaxial surfaces of the β costae. Plants of group A have chloroplast DNA sequences closely related to plants of G. dicarpa from Australia and New Caledonia (D.J. Ohlsen et al. unpub.). Group A plants occur definitely in (southern) Westland, Canterbury, and Southland Ecological Provinces, possibly Stewart Island and in the eastern North Island (e.g., Kaweka Ranges, L.R. Perrie et al. 2983 , WELT P020672), and perhaps sporadically elsewhere. Group A plants match the morphology of some plants of G. dicarpa in Australia and, given the close genetic relationship, are probably conspecific. However, Australian G. dicarpa might include more than one species as it is morphologically variable. For instance, the ultimate segments of some (but not all) Australian plants, including the lectotype of G. dicarpa , are strongly pouched with a pronounced lamina flange alongside the abaxial surface of the α costae. This feature does not occur in G. dicarpa from New Zealand, but is uniformly present in New Caledonia. The lectotype is otherwise similar to group A, except only in the smallest of three frond pieces are the stellate scales on the abaxial surface of the β costae darkly coloured with patent branches; in the two larger frond pieces, the corresponding indumentum is paler brown with twisted branches. The significance of this variation in Australia is unclear. B) Plants with scales on the abaxial surface of the α costae that are not percurrent and ultimate segments with a glabrous abaxial surface (e.g., Heaphy Track, L.R. Perrie 4495 , WELT P026785; Atarau, L.R. Perrie 6373 & L.D. Shepherd , WELT P026787). Plants of group B have chloroplast DNA 17sequences closely related to G. microphylla (Perrie et al. 2012) and G. mendellii (G.Schneid.) S.B.Andrews (D.J. Ohlsen et al. unpub.). Group B plants occur from the north of the North Island to Stewart Island; they are the most widespread and common G. dicarpa group in New Zealand, and the only form of G. dicarpa found in large parts of the country. The relationship of group B plants to G. mendellii from Australia requires investigation. Gleichenia mendellii shares the scale characteristics described above for group B plants, along with ultimate segments that are glaucous on their abaxial surface and relatively weakly pouched. However, the epitype of G. mendellii (Queensland, Russell Is., P.R. Sharpe 3130 , BRI AQ0370733) differs in having a higher frequency of sori with more than two sporangia and sparser indumentum on the abaxial surface of the β costae. Based on their morphology, other Australian plants outside the currently accepted distribution of G. mendellii (south- eastern Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales; Chinnock & Bell 1998), and attributed to G. dicarpa , also need re-examination (e.g., Tasmania, Gordon River, A.T. Dobson 77029 , CHR 313699). C) Plants from the Chatham Islands (e.g., Chatham Island, P.J. de Lange CH919 & P.B. Heenan , AK 300719; Chatham Island, C.H. Hay s.n. , 23 June 2007, WELT P026814). This is the only Gleichenia recorded from the Chatham Islands. Like those of group A, plants of group C have percurrent scales on the abaxial surface of the α costae and scales on the abaxial surface of the ultimate segments. Group C plants differ in that the stellate scales on the abaxial surface of the β costae have curled or twisted rather than stiffly patent branches. Chloroplast DNA sequences of group C plants are more closely related to group B plants (and G. microphylla ) than to group A plants and Australian G. dicarpa (D.J. Ohlsen et al. unpub.). D) Plants with percurrent scales on the abaxial surface of the α costae and scales on the abaxial surface of the ultimate segments (e.g., Karikari Peninsula, L.R. Perrie 4193 , WELT P021155; near Taipa, L.R. Perrie et al. 6405 , WELT P026777). The scales on the abaxial surface of the α costae have bodies usually less than 300 µm wide, such that they appear as a mass of tangled hairs (actually their cilia). This usually distinguishes them from groups A and C, whose wider scales on the abaxial surface of the α costae are quite evident. Additionally, group D plants have prominent, branched accessory leaflets around their rachis buds (like group B plants), but these are often lacking in group A and C plants (and are unbranched when present). Chloroplast DNA sequences of group D plants match those of group B plants (D.J. Ohlsen et al. unpub.). Plants of group D dominate G. dicarpa populations in Northland, are common in Auckland (together with group B plants), and appear to infrequently extend south to Taranaki and Volcanic Plateau Ecological Provinces. In addition to its morphological and genetic variation, the taxonomy of Gleichenia dicarpa is further complicated by its nomenclature, particularly the long-confused G. circinnata Sw. (Christensen 1910; Holttum 1959; Brownsey et al. 1985). This was described by Swartz (1801), but only later said to be from Australia (Swartz 1806). It has been variously confused with both G. dicarpa and G. microphylla , both also described from Australian material, and both post-dating G. circinnata . The putative type material of G. circinnata , S P4151 and P4153 (online!), is fragmentary, but is clearly not G. microphylla . Holttum (1959), noting conflict with the protologue, argued that it was also not equivalent to G. dicarpa , but this requires re-evaluation in the context of a detailed review of the morphological variation in Australasian G. dicarpa . This should be done before making substantive nomenclatural changes, particularly given that G. dicarpa as currently circumscribed may comprise a complex of species in Australasia; in that context, G. circinnata and G. dicarpa may or may not be synonymous. Gleichenia dicarpa has been attributed to New Caledonia and Philippines (e.g., Holttum 1959). However, the relationship of plants outside Australasia to Australian material representative of the type, and to the Malesian G. vulcanica Blume, requires re-evaluation. The lectotype of Gleichenia hecistophylla A.Cunn. appears to belong to group B of G. dicarpa , but the other syntype belongs to group D (Perrie & Brownsey 2015). The Tasmanian holotype of Calymella major Nakai has a morphology not found in New Zealand. 18Fig. 41 : Gleichenia dicarpa . Group B. Habit. Fig. 42 : Gleichenia dicarpa . Group B. Frond.

"Gleichenia inclusisora Perrie, L.D.Sheph. & Brownsey, New Zealand J. Bot. 50: 406 (2012)",,,"Gleichenia inclusisora occurs in pakihi (wet, infertile heaths) and open shrubland/treeland. It regularly occurs with other Gleichenia species, particularly G. dicarpa .Gleichenia inclusisora tends to be in rockier sites than G. dicarpa . Recognition: Gleichenia inclusisora is recognised by the sori being embedded within lamina pits, and by the comparatively large, bicolorous, ± orbicular scales on the abaxial surface of the laminae. Hybridisation: A single collection (Denniston, F. Overmars A17 , WELT P026702, P026703) indicates that Gleichenia inclusisora hybridises rarely with G. alpina .

"Gleichenia microphylla R.Br., Prodr. Fl. Nov. Holland., 161 (1810)",,110-1600mm-long,"Gleichenia microphylla frequently occurs in Leptospermum /Kunzea and other scrub, as well as open situations within other forest types (kauri, podocarp, beech, broadleaved, and/or plantation), particularly along natural or human-induced margins (e.g., along roads and tracks). It occurs in or around swamps and other wet ground, but extends to ridges, and to rocky and poor substrates (e.g., clay, ultrabasic). Gleichenia microphylla tends to occupy more shaded and drier sites than G. dicarpa , but they often co-occur. Recognition: Gleichenia microphylla has complanate or recurved ultimate segments with green abaxial surfaces, and at least some of them have cuspidate (± triangular) apices. The indumentum on the abaxial surface of the β costae is dominated by stellate scales with stiffly patent branches. Most sori have more than 2 sporangia. It thus differs substantially from G. dicarpa , which has pouched or recurved ultimate segments with white or glaucous abaxial surfaces and rounded apices, an indumentum on the abaxial surface of the β costae comprising an intergrading mix of ciliate ovate scales and stellate scales, and sori mostly with 2 sporangia. However, putative hybrids combining the character states of both species and/or with intermediate character states are widespread and fairly common. Cytology: n = 20 (Brownlie 1961) Hybridisation: Morphological intermediates between Gleichenia microphylla and G. dicarpa are common (e.g., plants with ± complanate ultimate segments that are glaucous on their abaxial surface). These are potentially hybrids and that is how they are treated here (see Gleichenia ×punctulata ). Notes: One of the syntypes of Gleichenia patens Colenso, WELT P002911, has pinna buds that extend to an unusual degree. This is likely the basis of Cheeseman’s opinion (1925, p.85) that Gleichenia patens is “an excessively proliferous state”. Gleichenia semivestita Labill. is a synonym of G. microphylla (Perrie & Brownsey 2015). The former was described from New Caledonia. This may be the source of the attribution of G. microphylla to New Caledonia. However, Brownlie (1969) did not record it, and modern collections do not support the presence of G. microphylla in New Caledonia. Labillardière (1824) may have mistakenly attributed Australian material of G. microphylla to New Caledonia. Malesian plants have also been attributed to Gleichenia microphylla (Holttum 1959). However, this needs re-examination because at least some of these plants differ from Australian and New Zealand 26material in having patently-branched stellate scales ± percurrent on the β costae (Malaysia, Mount Ophir, Shah 3604 & Ahmad , CHR 304103), and in having glaucous abaxial surfaces on the ultimate segments (Piggot 1988).

Distribution: Putative hybrids between Gleichenia dicarpa and G. microphylla are found throughout the broad area of overlapping distributions of the parental species, from the northern North Island to Stewart Island. Biostatus: Indigenous (Non-endemic). The presence of Gleichenia ×punctulata in Australia is likely but requires confirmation. Habitat: The putative hybrids are found in the same habitats as G. dicarpa and G. microphylla , and usually grow with one or both of the parental species. Recognition: Morphologically intermediate between Gleichenia dicarpa and G. microphylla , combining character states found in the putative parents and/or with intermediate character states: e.g., plants with ± complanate ultimate segments that are glaucous on their abaxial surface, or plants 28with pouched ultimate segments but indumentum on the costae dominated by stellate scales with stiffly patent branches. The name G. ×punctulata applies to this hybrid combination. Notes: Morphological intermediates between Gleichenia dicarpa and G. microphylla are common. These are potentially hybrids and, while substantiating evidence is lacking (e.g., from spore morphology or genetics), that is how they are treated here. Their spores appear to be normally formed. While abnormally-formed spores provide strong evidence of hybridity in ferns, spores that appear normal do not rule out the plants being hybrids. Most putative hybrids with Gleichenia microphylla involve the G. dicarpa morphological variant lacking both percurrent scales on the abaxial surface of the α costae and scales on the abaxial surface of the ultimate segments (group B; see Notes under G. dicarpa ). But plants of G. dicarpa with percurrent scales on the abaxial surface of the α costae and scales on the abaxial surface of the ultimate segments from the northern North Island (group D; see Notes under G. dicarpa ) also putatively hybridise with G. microphylla (e.g., Kawerua, A.E. Wright s.n. , 13 May 1974, AK 223063; Opua, L.R. Perrie 4814 , WELT P022337), although these are not included in the Gleichenia key. Perrie & Brownsey (2015) noted that most of the syntype material of Gleichenia punctulata appears to be the hybrid between G. dicarpa and G. microphylla . The single exception is the piece at lower-left of WELT P003355/B, which belongs to group D of G. dicarpa (see Notes under G. dicarpa ). Furthermore, Colenso’s protologue relates to both taxa (Perrie & Brownsey 2015). The lectotype was therefore selected to attach Colenso’s name to the bulk of the syntype material. It is not clear which group of Gleichenia dicarpa is involved in the hybrid combination represented by the lectotype. While it was evidently collected with a specimen of group D, the lectotype lacks both percurrent scales on the abaxial surface of the α costae and scales on the abaxial surface of the ultimate segments, consistent with group B rather than group D. However, it is uncertain how these characters are expressed in hybrids of group D with G. microphylla , although at least some such putative hybrids have scales on the abaxial surface of the ultimate segments (see above). Given the taxonomy adopted here, the binomial Gleichenia ×punctulata can be used for hybrids between G. dicarpa and G. microphylla . We note, however, that if segregates are formally recognised within what we here treat as G. dicarpa , the name G. ×punctulata may be difficult to apply. This is because of the uncertain parentage of the lectotype, discussed above. Sticherus C.Presl, Tent. Pterid., 51 (1836) Type taxon: Sticherus laevigatus (Willd.) C.Presl Etymology: From the Greek stichos (in a row or line), possibly a reference to the ordered rows of elongate ultimate segments. Vernacular name: umbrella ferns Terrestrial ferns. Rhizomes long-creeping, scaly. Stipes scaly or glabrescent. Rachis with pinnate laminae (not NZ), or reduced to a bud at the apex of the stipe with a single pair of pinnae (NZ); rachis buds sometimes extending to produce another tier comprising a rachis terminating in another rachis bud and pair of pinnae (NZ). Pinnae unforked, being equivalent to an ultimate segment (not NZ) or to an ultimate leaflet (rarely NZ), or forking pseudodichotomously 1 to several times (NZ); buds at bifurcations sometimes extending 1-several times. Laminae, axes, and rachis and pinna buds bearing scales, sometimes hair-like. β costae bearing costal segments. α costae of the ultimate leaflets arising pseudodichotomously from distal end of β costae. Ultimate segments on α costa >4 mm long, oblong or linear, entire or crenulate, with once-branched veins between midvein and margin. Sori superficial, 3–18 either side of midvein, each with 3–5 sporangia. Spores monolete, rugulate and perforate. Taxonomy: A genus of about 95 species (Gonzales & Kessler 2011). Allan (1961) included Sticherus in a broadly-circumscribed Gleichenia . The nomenclatural history of Sticherus was detailed by Pichi Sermolli (1972). The New Zealand species of Sticherus were reviewed by Brownsey et al. (2013). 1 Proximal-most costae with 3–8 pairs of costal segments; ultimate segments arising at 70–85° from α costae ...................................................................................... tener Proximal-most costae usually with 0–2 pairs of costal segments (excluding pseudostipules), rarely 3–4; ultimate segments arising at 40–70° from α costae .................. 2 292 Scales on abaxial surface of α costae ovate, >250 mm wide; ultimate segments abaxially glaucous, 5–20 mm long .................................................... cunninghamii Scales on abaxial surface of α costae acicular or hair-like, <200 mm wide; ultimate segments abaxially green, 8–55 mm long ................................................................ 3 3 α costae >10 times longer than proximal-most costae; ultimate segments crenulate, crenulations extending along length of margin; angle between pairs of ultimate leaflets in centre of laminae usually 20–40°; confined to northern North Island .............................................................................................. flabellatus α costae usually <10 times longer than proximal-most costae; ultimate segments entire or crenulate, crenulations often restricted to apex; angle between pairs of ultimate leaflets in centre of laminae often 40–60°; confined to South Island ........................................................................................................ urceolatus Distribution: Widespread in tropical and southern temperate regions, although very few species in Africa; 54 species occur in the Neotropics (Gonzales & Kessler 2011), about 16 in Malesia (Holttum 1959) and nine in the tropical Pacific; in the southern temperate zone there are five species in both Chile (Marticorena & Rodríguez 1995) and Australia (Chinnock & Bell 1998). Four species in New Zealand; one endemic. Biostatus: Indigenous (Non-endemic). Table 4 : Number of species in New Zealand within Sticherus C.Presl Category Number Indigenous (Endemic) 1 Indigenous (Non-endemic) 3 Total 4 Recognition: Sticherus can be distinguished from the superficially-similar Dicranopteris by the presence of laminae on the axes subtending the pseudodichotomously-paired ultimate leaflets; that is, Sticherus has costal segments on the β costae, and Dicranopteris does not. In New Zealand, the ultimate segments of at least 5 mm in length distinguish Sticherus from Gleichenia , which has ultimate segments <3 mm long. Cytology: The base chromosome number in Sticherus is x = 34 (Kramer 1990). Fig. 83 : Sticherus cunninghamii .

Sticherus cunninghamii (Heward ex Hook.),,140-980mm-long,"Sticherus cunninghamii occurs in all major forest types, as well as in scrub. It extends rarely to subalpine grassland. It grows in the open or in shade, and while often found in drier sites like ridges and banks, it can also occur on wet ground. Recognition: The abaxially glaucous ultimate segments and prominent scales on the abaxial surface of the α costae distinguish Sticherus cunninghamii from the other Sticherus species in New Zealand. Cytology: n = 34 (Brownlie 1958). Hybridisation: Sticherus cunninghamii hybridises infrequently with all of the other Sticherus species in New Zealand. Hybrids can usually be recognised by their intermediate frond and scale characteristics and abnormally formed spores. Hybrids with S. tener and S. urceolatus were documented by Brownsey et al. (2013). Based on morphological intermediacy, hybrids between S. cunninghamii and S. flabellatus also occur, albeit infrequently (e.g., abaxially glaucous, but with 31caudate leaflets, and scales on the abaxial surface of the α costae of intermediate width): unlocalised, Colenso s.n. , WELT P002888, P002890, P002891, P002897, P002905; Whangarei, A.J.

Sticherus flabellatus (R.Br.),,180-1490mm-long,"Sticherus flabellatus frequently occurs alongside waterways, roads, and tracks, but also on bluffs, and in swamps, gumlands, and other habitats associated with high light levels. It is usually associated with scrub or low, open forest, principally Leptospermum and/or Kunzea , but it can occur in gaps within Agathis australis , podocarp, and/or broadleaved (e.g., Weinmannia , Beilschmiedia ) forest. Recognition: The crenulate and abaxially green ultimate segments, usually caudate leaflets, acicular or hair-like scales on the abaxial surface of the α costae, and the ultimate segments arising at ≤70° from the α costae distinguish Sticherus flabellatus from S. cunninghamii and S. tener . Sticherus flabellatus is very similar to S. urceolatus , but the former usually has longer α costae relative to the proximal-most costae, and more pronounced serrations of the ultimate segments. The difference in ploidy is reflected in the smaller spore size of S. flabellatus (32–35 µm long, 17–19 µm wide cf. 38–43 µm long, 19–23 µm wide for S. urceolatus ). In New Zealand, S. flabellatus (northern North Island) and S. urceolatus (northern and western South Island) are allopatric. Cytology: n = 34 (Brownlie 1961) Hybridisation: Sticherus flabellatus hybridises, albeit infrequently, with S. cunninghamii , based on morphological intermediacy (e.g., abaxially glaucous, but with caudate leaflets, and scales on the abaxial surface of the α costae of intermediate width): unlocalised, Colenso s.n. , WELT P002888, P002890, P002891, P002897, P002905; Whangarei, A.J. Dakin s.n. , AK 213848; Great Barrier Island, A.E. Wright s.n. , AK 220418. The spores of WELT P002891 include a high proportion of irregular shapes, supporting the inference of hybridity. Furthermore, S. flabellatus may be a diploid progenitor, together with S. tener , of the tetraploid and putatively allopolyploid S. urceolatus (Brownsey et al. 2013). Notes: Chinnock & Bell (1998) accepted two varieties in Australia, distinguished by segment and sporangia size. The typical variety was attributed to New Zealand. The other variety, var. compactus (C.T.White & Goy) D.A.Sm., is endemic to northern Australia. In relation to Gleichenia littoralis Colenso, the statement by Allan (1961, p.21) that “Colenso based his description on the Great Barrier specimens; the type specimen, at W [WELT]…” constitutes lectotypification because there is only one collection in WELT from Great Barrier Island (WELT P003359). It comprises three fronds. The other syntypes are: New Zealand, W. Colenso s.n. , com. Dec. 1885, K! (photo WELT E471/9); Whangaruru Harbour, W.

Sticherus tener (R.Br.),,200-630mm-long,"The Sticherus tener populations near Westport occur within sandstone overhangs and on steep banks, amongst low woody vegetation. The Fiordland populations occur on poor soils under scrub or low, mixed forest, but extend into taller beech/podocarp forest. Recognition: The near right angle (70–85°) at which the ultimate segments arise from the α costae, and the 3–8 pairs of costal segments on the proximal-most costae distinguish Sticherus tener from the other Sticherus species in New Zealand. Cytology: No count has been made from New Zealand material of Sticherus tener , but n = 34 has been reported for Australian material (Garrett et al. 1998). Hybridisation: Sticherus tener hybridises with S. cunninghamii (Brownsey et al. 2013). Hybrids can usually be recognised by their intermediate frond and scale characteristics and abnormally formed spores. Additionally, S. tener may be a diploid progenitor, together with S. flabellatus , of the tetraploid and putatively allopolyploid S. urceolatus (Brownsey et al. 2013). Notes: New Zealand material is not known to reach the frond size, the number of tiers of pinnae, or extent of pinna forking recorded for Australia (Garrett et al. 1998). Fig. 100 : Sticherus tener .

"Sticherus urceolatus M.Garrett & Kantvilas in Garrett et al., Muelleria 11: 103 (1998)",,120-930mm-long,"The Sticherus urceolatus populations near Westport occur on steep, north-facing cliffs, and along streamsides, track cuttings and roadsides amongst low, woody vegetation, and in more open areas on sloping river banks. The population in Golden Bay occurs on shoreline bluffs including coal measures amongst low, woody vegetation. A nearby site with S. cunninghamii × S. urceolatus comprises sandy granite soil beside a river, under a light forest canopy. Recognition: The crenulate and abaxially green ultimate segments, acicular or hair-like scales on the abaxial surface of the α costae, and the ultimate segments arising at ≤70° from the α costae distinguish Sticherus urceolatus from S. cunninghamii and S. tener . Sticherus urceolatus is very similar to S. flabellatus , but the former usually has shorter α costae relative to the proximal-most costae, and less pronounced serrations on the ultimate segments. The difference in ploidy is reflected in the larger spore size of S. urceolatus (38–43 µm long, 19–23 µm wide cf. 32–35 µm long, 17–19 µm wide for S. flabellatus ). In New Zealand, S. urceolatus (northern and western South Island) and S. flabellatus (northern North Island) are allopatric. 38Cytology: No count has been made from New Zealand material of Sticherus urceolatus , but n = 68 has been reported for Australian material (Garrett et al. 1998). Hybridisation: Sticherus urceolatus hybridises with S. cunninghamii , although the hybrids can be difficult to distinguish (see Brownsey et al. 2013). The hybrid population in Golden Bay has abnormally formed spores. However, the material of putative hybrids from Fiordland available to Brownsey et al. (2013) was not sufficiently mature to check for the expected presence of abnormally formed spores. Notes: New Zealand material is not known to reach the frond size or the number of tiers of pinnae recorded for Australia (Garrett et al. 1998). Fig. 109 : Sticherus urceolatus . Frond.

Hymenophyllum armstrongii (Baker),,4-32mm-long,"Occurs most frequently as an epiphyte at lower altitudes, often intertwined with mosses and liverworts, on the branches of a wide variety of forest trees, but it is also found forming mats on damp rock, in rock crevices and under overhangs at higher altitudes. It occurs under kauri, podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest and in subalpine scrub, herbfield and tussock grassland. It has been recorded growing on Agathis australis , Dacrydium cupressinum , Dacrycarpus dacrydioides , Halocarpus biformis , Lepidothamnus intermedius , Phyllocladus alpinus , P. trichomanoides , Podocarpus laetus , Prumnopitys ferruginea , Archeria racemosa , Ixerba brexioides , Knightia excelsa , Kunzea ericoides , Metrosideros excelsa , M. robusta , M. umbellata , Quintinia sp., Weinmannia racemosa , W. silvicola and species of Nothofagaceae, but never on tree fern trunks. Recognition: Hymenophyllum armstrongii is recognised by its diminutive size, laminae with dark brown midribs and dark brown or blackish marginal spines, and solitary sori that terminate the lamina segments. It is easily overlooked, hidden among bryophytes, when growing epiphytically on tree branches. Cytology: n = 13 (Lovis in Brownsey 1991; Lovis in Dawson et al. 2000). Notes: The holotype specimen of Trichomanes armstrongii at K is a fragment only. There is a more complete specimen collected by J.B. Armstrong from the Black Range, Canterbury in March 1867 (WELT P006098), which may be the source of the material sent to Kew, but which cannot be definitely identified as an isotype. Hymenophyllum melanocheilos was described by Colenso (1885) from collections made at Whangaroa, County of Mongonui [Mangonui] in 1884 by R.W. Rowson.The lectotype was chosen by Allan (1961), citing “woods, Whangaroa, R.W. Rowson ” in WELT (now WELT P003295). There is a syntype in the Cheeseman herbarium (AK 139868). Both specimens bear the date 1885, rather than 1884 given in the protologue, and one or other date is assumed to be incorrect. Fig. 2 : Hymenophyllum armstrongii .

"Hymenophyllum australe Willd., Sp. Pl. 5 (1)",,38-210mm-long,"In New Zealand Hymenophyllum australe is restricted to a very specific habitat, usually growing on rock, or rarely low on tree trunks, in and around flowing water in shaded habitats. It can grow partially submerged or just above the level of flowing water, on boulders in stream beds, beside waterfalls or in seepages. In Australia the species grows in a wider range of habitats, extending to rock away from water, and as an epiphyte. Recognition: Hymenophyllum australe is a small to medium-sized filmy fern distinguished by its narrowly ovate frond, planate wings on the stipe, and habitat on rocks in or near streams. It can be distinguished from other species with winged stipes by its creeping rhizome (cf. erect rhizome in H. pulcherrimum ), indusial flaps lacking crests (cf. crested indusial flaps in H. sanguinolentum ), planate stipe wings (cf. flexuous wings in H. flexuosum ), and smaller lamina (30–140 mm long, 10–60 mm wide cf. 60–430 mm long, 40–170 mm wide in H. dilatatum and H. flexuosum ). Hymenophyllum australe is most easily confused with H. pluviatile but can be distinguished by its distinctive habitat (cf. epiphytic, terrestrial or rupestral in H. pluviatile ), its less divided frond (2–4- pinnatifid, cf. 4–5-pinnatifid), stipe wings which are broader and extend almost to the base, primary pinnae which tend to be curved acroscopically rather than straight, and ultimate lamina segments which are curved towards the frond apex rather than divergent, and are often emarginate rather than obtuse or truncate. Cytology: n = 36 (Brownlie 1965). Notes: This species was previously known as H. atrovirens and considered endemic to New Zealand (Allan 1961; Brownsey et al. 1985; Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth 2000). However, recent revisions 9(Ebihara et al. 2010; Perrie et al. 2013) have shown that the New Zealand plants are conspecific with H. australe , previously considered endemic to Australia. H. atrovirens was described by Colenso (1845) from collections he made on the shores of Lake Waikaremoana in December 1841. The lectotype was chosen by Allan (1961), citing “ Colenso , 1841” in WELT (now WELT P003267). There is also a specimen at K ( Colenso 275) which, although labelled “Bay of Islands” in Hooker’s hand-writing, was probably collected on Colenso’s journey through the Urewera district in 1841 and could be a syntype (photo WELT E468/12).

Hymenophyllum bivalve (G.Forst.),,90-350mm-long,"Occurs under podocarp, beech or broadleaved forest, and in kānuka or open scrub, growing on the ground, on rocks, banks, road cuttings, fallen trunks, at the base of tree trunks, or as a trunk epiphyte. It has been recorded growing on Cyathea dealbata , Dicksonia fibrosa , D. squarrosa , Griselinia littoralis , Libocedrus sp., Litsea calicaris , Weinmannia racemosa and species of Nothofagaceae . Recognition: Hymenophyllum bivalve is a highly divided, medium-sized filmy fern with a toothed margin. It is larger and more divided than all other New Zealand species with a toothed margin except H. multifidum , which is of comparable size. The two species are very hard to distinguish when sterile, but H. bivalve has laminae which are sometimes slightly larger, less obviously curled downwards, and more shallowly toothed on the margins, especially on the rachis wings. When fertile, the sori of H. bivalve are much smaller and never bent upwards at 90º to the plane of the frond. Cytology: n = 22 (Brownlie 1958). Notes: Hymenophyllum pyriforme was described by van den Bosch (1863) from specimens collected in New Zealand by D’Urville and by J.D. Hooker (the latter “inter specimina H. demissi H. Reg. Berol.”). However, no original material has been located in L, identified as Bosch’s main herbarium by 11Stafleu & Cowan (1976). Only one original specimen (B 200100381), without collector or locality but determined by Bosch in 1857 as H. pyriforme , has been located. Brownsey & Perrie (2016) noted that the specimen at B is clearly original material, and serves to confirm that H. pyriforme is synonymous with H. bivalve , but it does not accord with either of the specimens cited in the protologue. It is a candidate for lectotype if the specimens cited in the protologue cannot be located. The name Trichomanes pacificum Hedw., sometimes included in the synonymy of Hymenophyllum bivalve , is illegitimate because only the captions and not the plate were published (see Nicolson & Fosberg 2003). Hymenophyllum bivalve was recorded from the Auckland Islands by Johnson & Campbell (1975) and by Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth (2000). However, the voucher specimens (OTA 33132, 33133) were misidentified and are actually H. multifidum . Fig. 14 : Hymenophyllum bivalve .

"Hymenophyllum cupressiforme Labill., Nov. Holl. Pl. 2, 102, t. 250, f.2 (1806)",,15-75mm-long; 1-2.5mm-long,"Occurs under light shade in kānuka and mānuka scrub, and in beech forest, less commonly in podocarp or broadleaved forest, usually growing on the ground, on rocks, scoria, or banks in damp areas. Recognition: Hymenophyllum cupressiforme is one of several small filmy ferns in New Zealand with toothed margins. It is smaller than either H. bivalve or H. multifidum , and lacks the spines on the lamina margins of H. armstrongii , or the spines on the outer surfaces of the indusial flaps of H. minimum . It is very similar to H. revolutum and H. peltatum , but distinguished from the former by its rachises which are winged throughout, and its indusial flaps which are less prominently toothed, and from the latter by its solitary sori on each primary pinna, and by its secondary pinnae which arise both acroscopically and basiscopically. Occasionally the receptacles are slightly exserted, and the indusia bent upwards at an angle to the plane of the frond. Notes: Tindale (1963) stated that the holotype of H. cupressiforme was in FI, noting that Labillardière’s original description in his hand-writing was affixed to the specimen (FI 004205). However, there are also two other Labillardière collections in P which Tindale did not mention: Van 13Diemen [Tasmania], Labillardière , P 00623471! (photo WELT E476/9); Nov. Holland. [Australia], Labillardière , P – herb. Jussieu No. 1507! (photo WELT E478/7). We interpret these as separate syntypes. Nevertheless, Tindale’s original statement constitutes effective lectotypification. Hymenophyllum antarcticum was described as a new species by Presl (1843) citing “ H. tunbridgense , Sieb. syn. fil. n. 134, flora mixta n. 254. Habitat in Nova Hollandia ad Port Jackson, ubi legit Sieber”. There are collections labelled “Nova Hollandia, Sieber 134 ” or “Synops. Filicum No. 134” in many European herbaria including B, BR, E, L, LE, P, PRC, S and W. Presl’s own herbarium is held at PRC (Stafleu & Cowan 1983). A specimen of H. antarcticum , labelled “Neu Hollandia, Siber” in Presl’s handwriting, was seen at ""PR"" by Croxall (1975) but identified by him only as a “probable isotype”. Hymenophyllum antarcticum was accepted as a distinct species by Copeland (1938, p. 93), but reduced to synonymy under H. cupressiforme by Tindale (1963), Croxall (1975) and Bostock & Spokes (1998), but none of these authors identified the holotype or selected a lectotype. PRC 452914, excluding the frond at bottom left, was selected as lectotype by Brownsey & Perrie (2016). The occurrence of Hymenophyllum cupressiforme in New Zealand was first recorded by Parris & Croxall (1972); before then it had been confused with H. peltatum and H. revolutum .

Hymenophyllum demissum (G.Forst.),,75-450mm-long,"Hymenophyllum demissum is the most common of all filmy ferns, growing in kauri, podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest and in tall kānuka scrub and swamp forest, most frequently on the ground, or on rocks, banks and fallen trunks and stumps, but also as an epiphyte. It has been recorded on the trunks of Cyathea dealbata , C. kermadecensis , C. smithii , Dicksonia squarrosa , Agathis australis , Beilschmiedia tawa , Dacrydium cupressinum , Elaeocarpus dentatus , Fuscospora truncata , Lophozonia menziesii , Metrosideros excelsa , Prumnopitys taxifolia and Rhopalostylis sapida . Recognition: Hymenophyllum demissum is a medium to large filmy fern and the most common of all New Zealand filmy ferns. It is also the hardest to characterise, having few distinctive features, but can generally be recognised by its large, glabrous fronds with entire margins which are thickened to form a distinct border. The rachis is winged throughout but the stipe has no wing. The sori are often rather narrow and borne in pairs. The frond rarely curls up, even in dry weather, and the plant is often sterile over large areas. Some plants on the Kermadec Islands are distinctly smaller than those on the main islands, having fronds just 55 mm long, stipes 22 mm long, laminae 35 mm long and 18 mm wide, and the primary pinnae 13 mm long and 7 mm wide. Cytology: n = 36 (Brownlie 1954, 1958). Notes: Hymenophyllum erecto-alatum was described by Colenso (1879) from collections he made in dry forests near Forty-mile Bush, Norsewood in 1876 and 1878. There are two sheets at WELT and another at AK, all labelled “Norsewood”. WELT P003007 and AK 119 are annotated “type of H. erecto- alatum Col.” in Cheeseman’s hand-writing, whilst WELT P003286 has a label in Zotov’s writing copied from WELT P003007. Allan (1961, p. 28) cited a Colenso collection at WELT as the type but did not distinguish between the two sheets held there. However, Zotov’s label on WELT P003286 indicates that it is a copy of Cheeseman’s label on WELT P003007, and also that the material is part of the same specimen. It seems that Zotov segregated specimens from some of Colenso’s collections and re-labelled them (Brownsey 1979). In this case, Colenso’s material is now mounted on two sheets (with different registration numbers) but is part of the same specimen (Art. 8.3). Allan’s statement “Type: W, Colenso ” can therefore be taken as a lectotypification and relates to these two sheets (WELT P003007 and P003286). No type material of H. aucklandium has been located, and its inclusion in the synonymy of H. demissum relies on the opinion of Capeland (1937, p. 160) who said that he was unable to distinguish it from a small H. demissum (see Brownsey & Perrie 2016). 16Fig. 24 : Hymenophyllum demissum .

Hymenophyllum dilatatum (G.Forst.),,60-570mm-long,"Occurs under tall kānuka scrub, and in kauri, podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest, growing on the ground, on river banks, rock faces and fallen logs and trunks, or as an epiphyte in wet areas. It has been recorded most frequently on Cyathea medullaris , Dicksonia fibrosa and D. squarrosa but also on Elaeocarpus dentatus , Melicytus ramiflorus , Prumnopitys taxifolia and Coprosma chathamica (on the Chatham Islands). Recognition: Hymenophyllum dilatatum is the largest of the New Zealand filmy ferns, recognisable by its creeping rhizomes, glabrous laminae with entire margins, broad flat wing along the rachis and much of the stipe, very broad pinnae and pinna segments, and large almost round indusia partially immersed in the lamina. Cytology: n = 36 (Brownlie 1958). Notes: Hymenophyllum dilatatum , together with H. nephrophyllum and H. scabrum , is unusual in the genus in having a frond that is more than one cell thick. Holloway (1923) showed that sporelings had a lamina only one cell thick and that the multi-layered condition developed with maturity. 18Fig. 29 : Hymenophyllum dilatatum .

"Hymenophyllum flabellatum Labill., Nov. Holl. Pl. 2, 101, t. 250, f. 1 (1807)",,25-390mm-long,"Occurs under kauri, podocarp, beech, broadleaved forest and Olearia colensoi scrub, usually as an epiphyte but also hanging from rotten logs, fallen trunks and steep banks, at the base of trunks, and on boulders and wet rock faces. It has been recorded growing epiphytically on Cyathea dealbata , C. smithii , Dicksonia fibrosa , D. squarrosa , Beilschmiedia tawa , Libocedrus bidwillii , Melicytus ramiflorus , Metrosideros excelsa , M. kermadecensis , M. robusta , M. umbellata , Weinmannia racemosa , species of Nothofagaceae and hanging from Astelia clumps. Recognition: Hymenophyllum flabellatum is recognised by its pale or yellow-green fronds, flabellate pinnae, entire lamina margins and tufts of long yellow-brown hairs on the rhizome and stipes. When young, or growing on tree fern trunks, the species has small fronds with markedly fan-shaped pinnae which tend to curl upwards, away from the plane of the frond. Older fronds, or those growing on wet banks or rock overhangs, are much longer, with more drawn-out and dissected pinnae. The species is closely related to H. rufescens but grows at lower altitudes, and can usually be distinguished by its larger and almost glabrous laminae. Intermediate forms are sometimes found in areas where the two species meet, but whether these are hybrids is unclear. DNA sequencing suggests that the two species are distinct (Perrie et al. 2016). Cytology: n = 36 (Brownlie 1954). Notes: Plants of Hymenophyllum flabellatum in Australia tend to have larger fronds with more finely divided pinnae and narrower ultimate lamina segments. The pinnae are less obviously flabellate, and the small forms seen in New Zealand with markedly fan-shaped pinnae curling upwards are rare in Australia. The same chromosome number has been reported from populations in both countries (Brownlie 1954; Tindale & Roy 2002). Molecular evidence also suggests that populations in New 20Zealand and Australia probably belong to the same species, but that material from Fiji and Tahiti ascribed to H. flabellatum clearly belongs to a different species (Perrie et al. 2016). Tindale (1963) stated that the holotype of H. flabellatum was in FI, noting that Labillardière’s original description in his hand-writing was affixed to the specimen (FI 004176). However, there are also other Labillardière collections in B, GH and P which Tindale did not mention: Nov. Holland. [Australia], Ins. King [King Island], P – Herb. Jussieu No. 1506!

We interpret these as separate syntypes. Nevertheless, Tindale’s original statement constitutes effective lectotypification. Fig. 34 : Hymenophyllum flabellatum .

"Hymenophyllum flexuosum A.Cunn., Companion Bot. Mag. 2: 369 (1837)",,70-390mm-long; 45-295mm-long; 30-140mm-wide,"Occurs in podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest, and under mature kānuka, growing on the ground, in damp hollows, on damp rocks and banks, streamsides, under overhangs, on tree roots, on rotten logs and old tree stumps, and as a low trunk epiphyte. It has been recorded growing epiphytically on Cyathea dealbata , Dysoxylum spectabile , Fuchsia excorticata , Melicytus ramiflorus , Metrosideros sp., Rhopalostylis sapida and species of Nothofagaceae . Recognition: Hymenophyllum flexuosum is distinguished from almost all other species of the genus in New Zealand by the broad flexuous wings on the stipes, rachises and primary pinnae. It is similar only to H. australe and H. pluviatile . It can be distinguished from H. australe by its more divided laminae (4–5-pinnatifid cf. 2–4-pinnatifid), larger laminae (60–295 mm long, 40–140 mm wide, cf. 30–140 mm long, 10–60 mm wide), lamina shape (usually less than three times as long as broad cf. usually more than three times as long as broad) and flexuous rather than planate stipe and rachis wings. Hymenophyllum australe is further distinguished by growing only on rock in or beside streams, whereas H. flexuosum also grows epiphytically and on soil and rock away from streams. Hymenophyllum flexuosum can be distinguished from H. pluviatile by its larger laminae (60–295 mm long, 40–140 mm wide, cf. 40–130 mm long, 20–70 mm wide), flexuous and broad stipe wings that extend almost to the base, rather than very narrow planate stipe wings usually confined to the distal half, and generally wider lamina segments. Cytology: n = 36 (Brownlie 1961). Notes: The names Hymenophyllum javanicum Spreng. and H. crispatum Hook. & Grev. have been misapplied to this species by some New Zealand authors. 23Fig. 41 : Hymenophyllum flexuosum .

"Hymenophyllum frankliniae Colenso, Tasmanian J. Nat. Sci. 1: 378 (1843)",,40-295mm-long,"Occurs in wet kauri, podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest, most commonly as an epiphyte but also on rotten logs and stumps, and on wet rocks, bluffs or banks. It grows frequently on trunks of Dicksonia squarrosa and Cyathea smithii , but has also been recorded on C. medullaris , C. dealbata and Prumnopitys taxifolia . Recognition: Hymenophyllum frankliniae is immediately recognisable by the dense covering of tawny or rusty brown stellate hairs throughout the olive-green fronds. The only other New Zealand filmy ferns 25with branched hairs are H. lyallii , which has a light green flabellate frond with minute teeth and bifurcate hairs on the margins, and H. malingii , which has stellate grey hairs on the adaxial lamina surface, rusty brown hairs on the abaxial surface, and ultimate segments that are almost round in cross-section. Cytology: n = 36 (Brownlie 1958). Notes: Colenso (1843) first described this species as Hymenophyllum frankliniae , using the genitive form for the epithet. However, he later re-described it as H. franklinianum (Colenso 1845) using the adjectival form for the epithet. The name commemorates Lady Franklin, wife of Sir John Franklin, the then Governor of Tasmania, but since she did not actually collect the species and Colenso was merely commemorating her patronage, the adjectival form was considered more appropriate. The later name was subsequently cited in all subsequent New Zealand Floras, and the earlier name only mentioned again in the Supplementary Notes to Allan’s Flora (Allan 1961). However, the name H. frankliniae was published first, is correctly formed and cannot be considered an orthographic error to be corrected; it is therefore the correct name for this species when treated in Hymenophyllum . In his later description of H. franklinianum , Colenso (1845) cites H. frankliniae in synonymy. Hence H. franklinianum was nomenclaturally superfluous when published because the name that should have been used was cited in synonymy (Art. 52.1, 52.2e). It is best treated as a nomenclatural synonym of H. frankliniae based on the same type. The issue was further complicated by Hooker (1844–1846) who published the name H. aeruginosum var. franklinianum based on Colenso 272 sent to him as "" Hymenophyllum franklinianum n.sp."" by Colenso in a letter dated 1 September 1842 (St. George 2009). The publication of this name postdates Colenso's H. frankliniae of 1843, but predates his H. franklinianum of 1845. It must therefore be treated as a separate basionym with a different type. The basionyms Hymenophyllum aeruginosum Carmich., H. subtilissimum Kunze and H. ferrugineum Colla, and combinations based on them, have been widely misapplied to the species in New Zealand (Allan 1961; Brownsey et al. 1985; Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth 2000; see Ebihara et al. 2010). Morphological and molecular data indicate that H. ferrugineum and H. frankliniae are distinct species distributed in South America and New Zealand respectively (Iwatsuki 1982; Ebihara et al. 2004).

"Hymenophyllum lyallii Hook.f., Bot. Antarct. Voy. II (Fl. Nov.-Zel.)",,9-90mm-long,"Occurs in kauri, podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest, usually as an epiphyte or at the base of trunks, but also on old stumps, mossy banks, rock faces and under overhangs. It has been recorded growing on Cyathea dealbata , C. smithii , Dicksonia squarrosa , Dacrydium cupressinum , Lepidothamnus intermedius , Libocedrus bidwillii , Lophozonia menziesii , Metrosideros sp., Quintinia serrata and Weinmannia racemosa . Recognition: Hymenophyllum lyallii is distinguished by its flabellate fronds with minute marginal teeth bearing bifurcate hairs. No other New Zealand species of filmy fern has flabellate fronds or bifurcate hairs, although stellate hairs are present in H. frankliniae and H. malingii . However, sterile fronds of H. lyallii are often confused with a group of common liverworts, including Hymenophyton flabellatum and Symphyogyna species. Cytology: n = 36 (Brownlie 1965). Notes: Hymenophyllum lyallii has been recorded for New Caledonia by Ebihara et al. (2004). However, DNA sequencing suggests that New Caledonian plants are not closely related to Australian and New Zealand plants and may belong to a different species (Perrie et al. 2016).

Hymenophyllum malingii (Hook.),,40-360mm-long; 9-60mm-long; 3-12mm-wide,"Occurs most frequently on dead trunks of Libocedrus bidwillii , more rarely on trunks of Halocarpus biformis , Metrosideros umbellata , species of Nothofagaceae , and occasionally on boulders, rock faces and banks in montane beech or podocarp forest, or in subalpine tussock. Recognition: Hymenophyllum malingii is immediately recognisable by the complete covering of dense grey stellate hairs on the adaxial lamina surface, and rusty-brown stellate hairs on the abaxial surface. The laminae are usually narrowly ovate, and the lamina segments are almost round in cross- section, comprised entirely of enlarged costae. The only other New Zealand filmy ferns with branched hairs are H. lyallii , which has a light green flabellate frond with minute teeth and bifurcate hairs on the margins, and H. frankliniae , which has stellate tawny or rusty-brown hairs on the lamina surfaces. Unlike H. malingii, H. frankliniae has “normal” flattened lamina segments adjacent to the costae, and unbranched hairs on the rhizome. Cytology: n = 36 (Brownlie 1965). Notes: In addition to the lectotype chosen by Tindale (1963) there are two other syntype specimens at K: between Blind Bay and Massacre Bay, Brunner , Herbarium Hookerianum, K!

"Hymenophyllum minimum A.Rich., Voy. Astrolabe, Essai 91, t. 14, f. 2 (1832)",,6-30mm-long,"Grows most frequently on rocks, clay banks, logs and under overhangs, from exposed coastal sites to damp stream banks in mānuka, kānuka and Dracophyllum scrub, stunted southern rātā forest, beech forest or subalpine tussock. It often forms extensive mats on rock faces or turfs in exposed coastal habitats, but can also grow epiphytically on Melicytus ramiflorus , Metrosideros umbellata and Weinmannia racemosa . In the subantarctic it has been recorded growing on Carex sectoides in swamps. Recognition: Hymenophyllum minimum is one of the smallest filmy ferns in New Zealand. It is distinguished by its small size, toothed pinnae, a solitary sorus terminating each rachis, indusial flaps with toothed margins and spines on the outer surfaces, and receptacles that are often exserted for a short distance. When fertile, the usually stalked terminal sori will distinguish this species from other small species with toothed lamina margins, notably H. armstrongii , H. cupressiforme , H. peltatum and H. revolutum . Sterile fronds of H. minimum are usually simply pinnate and less divided than the latter three species, and lack the dark brown midribs and black marginal spines of H. armstrongii . Cytology: n = 26 (Lovis in Dawson et al. 2000). Notes: Hymenophyllum pumilio Rosenst. from New Caledonia was reduced to synonymy with H. minimum by Ebihara & Iwatsuki (2007), but the occurrence of the latter species in New Caledonia seemed improbable since it is absent from much of northern New Zealand. Perrie et al. (2016) reinstated H. pumilio as a New Caledonian endemic distinct from H. minimum. Lovis (1982) demonstrated that Colenso’s Hymenophyllum pygmaeum was a synonym of H. minimum rather than H. revolutum , the species with which it had been compared by earlier authors, including Allan (1961). 32Fig. 65 : Hymenophyllum minimum .

Hymenophyllum multifidum (G.Forst.),,13-380mm-long; 2-4mm-long; 6mm,"Occurs in a wide variety of habitats from kauri, podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest, to mānuka, kānuka, Olearia and Dracophyllum scrub, subalpine herbfield and tussock grassland. It grows on the ground, in boggy areas, on humus hummocks, Sphagnum , rocks, scoria, banks, cuttings, in rock crevices, on rotten stumps and logs, and at the base of trunks. It also grows epiphytically on a wide variety of trees, including Beilschmiedia tawa , Coprosma rugosa , Dacrycarpus dacrydioides , Dacrydium cupressinum , Dracophyllum filifolium , Elaeocarpus dentatus , Ixerba brexioides , Knightia excelsa , Metrosideros umbellata , Olearia colensoi , Prumnopitys ferruginea , Weinmannia racemosa and species of Nothofagaceae . Unusually for a species of Hymenophyllum , it is rarely found on tree fern trunks except on the Chatham Islands where is has been recorded from Dicksonia squarrosa . Recognition: Hymenophyllum multifidum is usually a medium-sized filmy fern, but varies considerably in size from small forms at high altitudes or in the far south of the country, to much larger plants in high rainfall areas of the west coast of the South Island. It is distinguished by its generally glabrous or sparsely hairy fronds, toothed margins, and large sori which are bent upward at right angles to the plane of the frond and have the receptacle exserted for a distance similar to the length of the indusial flaps. Plants in the far south of the South Island and on the subantarctic islands tend to have more divided fronds with narrower ultimate segments, slightly hairier laminae, and longer hairs on the rhizome compared to those further north. Hymenophyllum multifidum is a very tolerant and widespread species, growing best in damp areas, but curling tightly when dry. Sterile fronds are hard to distinguish from those of H. bivalve . However, H. multifidum generally has laminae which are slightly smaller, often obviously curled downwards, and have more pronounced teeth, especially on the rachis wings. Cytology: n = 26 (Brownlie 1954). 35Fig. 71 : Hymenophyllum multifidum . Fertile frond showing toothed wings on the rachis.Fig. 72 : Hymenophyllum multifidum .

"Hymenophyllum nephrophyllum Ebihara & K.Iwats. in Ebihara et al., Blumea 51: 234 (2006)",17-65mm-long; 25-105mm-wide,40-280mm-long,"Hymenophyllum nephrophyllum forms extensive mats on the forest floor, on fallen trunks, on banks and rocks, on lava fields, in moss forest, at the base of tree trunks and as a low epiphyte in kauri, podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, and in old kānuka scrub. Recognition: Hymenophyllum nephrophyllum is immediately recognised by its undivided, kidney- shaped lamina bearing numerous sori around the margin. The urceolate indusia and slightly exserted receptacles are unusual in Hymenophyllum , and account for the fact that the species has previously been included in Trichomanes (Allan 1961; Brownsey et al. 1985; Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth 2000) or the segregate genus Cardiomanes (Crookes 1963). It is now treated in the monotypic subgenus Cardiomanes (Ebihara et al. 2006). Cytology: n = 36 (Brownlie 1958). Notes: Hymenophyllum nephrophyllum is a nomen novum for Cardiomanes reniforme , required because the name Hymenophyllum reniforme is pre-occupied (Ebihara et al. 2010). Hymenophyllum nephrophyllum , together with H. dilatatum and H. scabrum , is unusual in the genus in having a frond that is more than one cell thick. Holloway (1923) showed that sporelings had a lamina only one cell thick and that the multi-layered condition developed with maturity. 37Fig. 78 : Hymenophyllum nephrophyllum .

Hymenophyllum peltatum (Poir.),,20-140mm-long,"Grows on the ground, or on rocks, banks, fallen logs or epiphytically, most frequently in beech, podocarp forest or Weinmannia forest, or in subalpine scrub or herbfield. It has been recorded as an epiphyte on Dracophyllum traversii , Fuchsia excorticata , Libocedrus bidwillii , Lophozonia menziesii , Metrosideros umbellata and Olearia colensoi . Unusually for a species of Hymenophyllum , it has not been recorded on tree fern trunks. Recognition: Hymenophyllum peltatum is one of several small filmy ferns in New Zealand with toothed lamina margins. It is smaller than either H. bivalve or H. multifidum , and lacks the marginal spines on the lamina segments in H. armstrongii or the spines on the back of the indusial flaps in H. minimum . It is very similar to H. revolutum and H. cupressiforme , but distinguished from the former by its rachises which are winged throughout and its indusial flaps which are entire, and from the latter by having up to three sori on each primary pinna rather than one, by its secondary pinnae which arise only acroscopically, and by its indusial flaps which are entire rather than shallowly toothed. 39Cytology: n = 11 (Brownlie 1958). Notes: A collection from the Waitakere Ranges made by Cheeseman (CHR 293698) is labelled by him as H. cheesemanii (= H. armstrongii ). However, the sheet includes material of both H. armstrongii (at the top) and H. peltatum (in the centre). The latter species is not known from the Waitakere Ranges today (Peter de Lange, pers. comm.), no other collections north of Mt Te Aroha are known, and it is unlikely to have been collected from Waitakere by Cheeseman. The sheet is from the Carse Herbarium and the specimen of H. peltatum was probably added in error after receipt from Cheeseman. Fig. 85 : Hymenophyllum peltatum .

"Hymenophyllum pluviatile Perrie & Brownsey in Perrie et al., New Zealand J. Bot. 51: 317 (2013)",,75-190mm-long,"Hymenophyllum pluviatile grows on rock, on soil banks, or as a low epiphyte on mossy tree trunks in wet, shaded beech, podocarp or broadleaved forest in areas with rainfall exceeding 1000 mm per year, and usually more than 1500 mm. It has been recorded as an epiphyte on Dacrydium cupressinum , Podocarpus sp., Prumnopitys ferruginea , Beilschmiedia tawa , Metrosideros umbellata and Myrsine sp. Recognition: Hymenophyllum pluviatile is a small to medium-sized filmy fern distinguished by its ovate or triangular frond and narrow planate wings on the stipe. It can be distinguished from other species with winged stipes by its creeping rhizome (cf. erect rhizome in H. pulcherrimum ), indusium flaps lacking crests (cf. crested indusial flaps in H. sanguinolentum ), narrow planate stipe wings (cf. broad, usually flexuous wings in H. flexuosum ), and smaller laminae (40–130 mm long, 20–70 mm wide cf. 60–430 mm long, 40–170 mm wide in H. dilatatum and H. flexuosum ). Hymenophyllum pluviatile is most easily confused with H. australe but can be distinguished by its epiphytic, rupestral or terrestrial habitat (cf. confined to rock in and near streams), its more divided frond (4–5-pinnatifid, cf. 2–4-pinnatifid), stipe wings which are very narrow and largely confined to the distal half, primary pinnae which tend to be straight rather than curved acroscopically, and ultimate lamina segments which are divergent rather than curved towards the frond apex, and are obtuse or truncate rather than emarginate.

Hymenophyllum polyanthos (Sw.),,90-100mm-long,"Recorded growing on Melicytus ramiflorus in wet Metrosideros forest at 450 m on Raoul Island, associated with Hymenophyllum demissum and Plagiochila pacifica . Recognition: Hymenophyllum polyanthos is similar to H. dilatatum , H. pluviatile and H. australe in having a planate wing extending at least half way down the stipe from the rachis. It can be distinguished from H. pluviatile and H. australe by the sori which are sunk into the lamina segments, rather than being adnate to the segments. It differs from H. dilatatum by the narrower ultimate lamina segments (c. 1 mm rather than 1.5–2 mm wide), the often emarginate rather than acute or obtuse apices, and the shape of the indusia which tend to be obovate rather than orbicular. It is also confined in New Zealand to the Kermadec Islands, unlike the other species which occur on the main islands. Notes: Ebihara et al. (2010) noted that H. polyanthos in the Pacific region forms a clade distinct from plants in the Neotropics and East Asia, and that it probably requires a new name.

"Hymenophyllum pulcherrimum Colenso, Tasmanian J. Nat. Sci. 2: 185 (1845)",,120-720mm-long,"Occurs in podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest, growing on rock, banks, rotting logs, at the base of tree trunks or epiphytically. It has been recorded growing on Coprosma sp., Griselinia littoralis ,Nestegis cunninghamii , Podocarpus laetus , Weinmannia racemosa and species of Nothofagaceae . Unusually for a species of Hymenophyllum , it does not grow on tree fern trunks. Recognition: Hymenophyllum pulcherrimum is the only New Zealand species of Hymenophyllum to have an erect or short-creeping rhizome. In addition, it can be recognised by its long, pendulous, glabrous and often rather flexuous fronds with winged rachises and stipes. It can sometimes be confused with H. flexuosum but the abundant red-brown rhizome hairs up to 7 mm long in H. pulcherrimum are very different to the scattered pale brown hairs up to 1 mm long confined to the stipe bases of H. flexuosum . Cytology: n = 36 (Brownlie 1961). Notes: Hymenophyllum pulcherrimum was described by Colenso (1845) from collections he made on the shores of Lake Waikaremoana in December 1841. The lectotype was chosen by Allan (1961), citing “ Colenso , December 1841” in WELT (now WELT P003271). There is also a specimen at K (Colenso 273 ) which is a syntype (photo WELT E468/26). Neither specimen bears the month “December” cited by Allan, and this is assumed to have been taken from the protologue. Fig. 102 : Hymenophyllum pulcherrimum .

"Hymenophyllum rarum R.Br., Prodr. Fl. Nov. Holland., 159 (1810)",,13-235mm-long; 10-200mm-long; 8-40mm-wide,"Occurs under kauri, podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest, and in mānuka, kānuka and subalpine scrub, often as an epiphyte but also growing on the ground, on dead stumps, at the base of tree trunks, on rock faces, clay banks, under overhangs and on scoria. It can grow in exposed sites as well as in shaded forest or scrub. It has been recorded growing epiphytically on a wide range of species including Cyathea dealbata , Dicksonia squarrosa , Beilschmiedia tawa , B. tarairi , Dacrycarpus dacrydioides , Elaeocarpus dentatus , Hedycarya arborea , Metrosideros excelsa , Olearia colensoi , Podocarpus laetus , P. totara , Prumnopitys ferruginea , Weinmannia racemosa , W. silvicola and species of Nothofagaceae , as well as hanging from clumps of Astelia . Recognition: Hymenophyllum rarum is a small filmy fern recognisable by its grey-green, very thin, glabrous laminae with entire margins, and sori immersed in the broad ultimate lamina segments. Despite its very thin frond, the species has remarkable resistance to drought, rarely curling up even in the driest conditions. Plants are occasionally found in which the primary pinnae are greatly extended, sometimes apparently growing out from the apices of the originally-formed pinnae, and occurring randomly along the length of the lamina. 48Cytology: n = 36 (Brownlie 1954). Notes: New Zealand plants of Hymenophyllum rarum often have slightly broader and more imbricate lamina segments than Australian plants which have narrower and more widely spaced segments. New Zealand plants also tend to be grey-green in colour unlike Australian plants which are dark green. Tindale (1963) noted that Australian plants had a “peculiar odour”, although whether this was in fresh or dried material was not stated. No reference was made to New Zealand plants, but some local botanists have noted a distinct metallic fragrance in New Zealand plants, especially in dried material (Peter de Lange, pers. comm.). Tindale & Roy (2002) reported n = 56–58 and n = 58 in two populations from New South Wales, whereas Brownlie (1954) reported n = 36 in a plant from New Zealand. Brownlie’s count was not supported by a photograph of the meiotic preparation so it is impossible to verify, but the number alone suggests that populations in Australia and New Zealand might be fundamentally different. Subgenus Mecodium , to which H. rarum belongs, has a base chromosome number of n = 28 (Ebihara et al. 2006). The lectotype of H. rarum was collected in Tasmania by Robert Brown, whereas the holotype of H. semibivalve was collected in New Zealand by Archibald Menzies (probably from Dusky Sound). However, the morphological differences usually apparent between Australian and New Zealand populations are not evident in these two collections which are both more similar to Australian plants. The lectotype of H. imbricatum , from the North Island of New Zealand, has broad and strongly imbricate lamina segments, but the name is illegitimate, being a later homonym of H. imbricatum Blume. The existing evidence is therefore equivocal but suggests that further work is needed to establish whether New Zealand and Australian plants belong to different species, or whether more than one taxon is present in either New Zealand or Australia or both.

"Hymenophyllum revolutum Colenso, Tasmanian J. Nat. Sci. 2: 186 (1845)",,11-100mm-long,"Occurs under kauri, podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest, in kānuka and mānuka scrub and rarely in subalpine scrub, growing on the ground, on damp moss-covered banks and rocks, on rotten logs and stumps, at the base of tree trunks and as an epiphyte. It has been recorded growing on Cyathea dealbata , C. medullaris , C. smithii , Dicksonia squarrosa , Cordyline australis , Dacrydium cupressinum , Metrosideros excelsa , Myrsine salicina , Pseudopanax chathamicus , Weinmannia racemosa and species of Nothofagaceae . Recognition: Hymenophyllum revolutum is one of several small filmy ferns in New Zealand with toothed margins. It is smaller than either H. bivalve or H. multifidum , and lacks the marginal spines on the lamina segments in H. armstrongii or the spines on the outer surfaces of the indusial flaps in H. minimum . It is very similar to H. peltatum and H. cupressiforme , but distinguished by its rachises which are winged only in the distal half and its indusial flaps which are strongly toothed. It is further distinguished from H. peltatum by having a single sorus on each primary pinna rather than up to three, and by its secondary lamina segments which arise basiscopically as well as acroscopically. Small sterile fronds may be confused with those of H. minimum but are usually at least pinnate-pinnatifid rather than pinnate. Cytology: n = 22 (Brownlie 1958). Notes: The name Hymenophyllum tunbridgense (L.) Sm., a species of western Europe, has been widely misapplied to this species. Hymenophyllum revolutum was described by Colenso (1845) from collections he made on the shores of Lake Waikaremoana in December 1841. The lectotype was chosen by Allan (1961), citing “WELT, Colenso ” (now WELT P003270). There are also syntype specimens at K ( Colenso 276 – photo WELT E468/28) and in the Cheeseman Herbarium (AK 128411). Hymenophyllum zeelandicum was described by Bosch (1863) from specimens collected by J.D. Hooker at the Bay of Islands, and by Wilkes in New Zealand. No original material was located in L, identified as Bosch’s main herbarium by Stafleu & Cowan (1976). However, a specimen in K, indentified by Bosch, has been designated as lectotype by Brownsey & Perrie (2016). 51Fig. 114 : Hymenophyllum revolutum .

"Hymenophyllum rufescens Kirk, Trans. & Proc. New Zealand Inst. 11: 457, t. 19a (1879)",,25-130mm-long; 4-26mm-long; 3-19mm-wide,"Occurs in podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest growing on rocks, banks, rotten logs and stumps, on tree roots, the bases of tree trunks and as a low epiphyte on the trunks of Dacrydium cupressinum ,Libocedrus bidwillii , Metrosideros umbellata , Podocarpus laetus , and on species of Phyllocladus , Quintinia and Nothofagaceae . It has not been recorded from tree fern trunks. Recognition: Hymenophyllum rufescens is recognised by its fronds with usually small triangular laminae abundantly covered in villous pale brown hairs, and stipes which are as long as, or longer than, the laminae. It is closely related to H. flabellatum but grows at higher altitudes, and can usually be distinguished by its smaller and much hairier laminae. Intermediate forms are sometimes found in areas where the two species meet, but whether these are hybrids is unclear. Cytology: n = 36 (Brownlie 1965). Notes: The original lectotype designated by Allan (1961, p. 26) has been lost and a replacement lectotype selected by Brownsey & Perrie (2016).

Hymenophyllum sanguinolentum (G.Forst.),,50-440mm-long,"Occurs under kauri, podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest or in mānuka and kānuka scrub, growing on the ground, on rocks and lava, on banks, rock faces, rotten logs and stumps or as an epiphyte. It has been recorded on a wide variety of forest trees including Cyathea dealbata ,C. medullaris ,C. milnei , Beilschmiedia tawa , Carpodetus serratus , Dacrycarpus dacrydioides , Dacrydium cupressinum , Dysoxylum spectabile , Griselinia littoralis , Knightia excelsa , Kunzea spp., Leptospermum scoparium , Metrosideros excelsa , M. umbellata , Phyllocladus trichomanoides , Podocarpus totara , Prumnopitys ferruginea , P. taxifolia , Vitex lucens and Weinmannia racemosa as well as hanging from clumps of Astelia . Recognition: Hymenophyllum sanguinolentum is a small to medium-sized filmy fern distinguished by its entire lamina margins, black zig-zagged rachis, winged rachis and stipe, and crests on the outer surfaces of the indusial flaps. It is more or less glabrous throughout much of its range but generally somewhat hairier in the northern part of its distribution. When dry it has a strong smell and stains paper dark brown or yellow. It is a very drought resistant filmy fern, curling into a tight ball in dry weather. It is very similar to H. villosum , but is usually distinguished by its glabrous to sparsely hairy fronds, broader ultimate segments (0.8–1.5 mm wide cf. 0.4–1.2 mm wide), and indusial flaps which are often broader than long and have crests on their outer surfaces. The crests on the indusial flaps are not found in any other New Zealand species, but they are not always obvious, especially in dried specimens. Hymenophyllum sanguinolentum generally grows at lower altitudes than H. villosum (0–900 vs 370–1300 m in the North Island; 0–850 vs 30–1650 m in the South Island). Nevertheless there is a significant zone of overlap and plants of both species occur together in several places. Cytology: n = 34, 68 (Daellenbach 1982), 36, 72 (Brownlie 1954, 1961) Notes: The name Hymenophyllum polyanthos (Sw.) Sw. has been widely misapplied to this species. Hymenophyllum sanguinolentum was recorded from the Auckland Islands by Johnson & Campbell (1975) but the voucher specimen (OTA 33363) was misidentified and is actually H. villosum . It was also recorded from the Three Kings Islands, in error for the Kermadec Islands, by Brownsey & Smith- Dodsworth (2000). Hymenophyllum lophocarpum was described by Colenso (1885) from collections he made in Seventy- mile Bush, County of Waipawa, from 1860–84. There are two specimens at K labelled “Hymenophyllum lophocarpum Col. sp. nov.” in Colenso’s writing; one is annotated “New Zealand, W. Colenso , rec’d xii 1885” (photo WELT E468/32), and the other “70 m[ile] Bush, com. W. Colenso 5/1890” (photo WELT E468/31). There are another two specimens at WELT. One is labelled “Dannevirke, type of H. lophocarpum” in Cheeseman’s writing and “ Hymenophyllum lopho/, sent Kew the best spns” in Colenso’s writing (WELT P002923). The other has a label copied from WELT P002923 in Zotov’s writing (WELT P003302). There are also two specimens at AK labelled “Dannevirke, type of H. lophocarpum” in Cheeseman’s writing (AK 83, 218893). Allan (1961, p. 26) cited a Colenso collection at WELT as the type but did not distinguish between the two sheets held there. However, Zotov’s label on WELT P003302 indicates that the material on that sheet is part of the collection labelled by both Colenso and Cheeseman (WELT P002923). It seems that Zotov segregated 55specimens from some of Colenso’s collections and re-labelled them (Brownsey 1979). In this case, Colenso’s material is now mounted on two sheets (with different numbers) but is part of the same specimen (Art. 8.3). Allan’s statement that the type is in WELT can therefore be taken as a lectotypification and relates to these two sheets (WELT P002923 and P003302). Some plants of H. sanguinolentum and all of H. villosum that have been examined have n = 34 or 36. However, tetraploid plants of H. sanguinolentum with n = 68 or 72 have been recorded from the Port Hills, Banks Peninsula, Mt Grey and Peel Forest in Canterbury (see Dawson et al. 2000). Hybrid plants have also been detected at Mt Grey, Canterbury that show formation of trivalents, bivalents and univalents at meiosis (Lovis in Dawson et al. 2000). Analysis of the meitotic pairing indicated that these are likely to have been hybrids between tetraploid H. sanguinolentum and diploid H. villosum . Some plants appear morphologically intermediate between the two presumed diploid species. Most frequently, such plants are recognised by having hairy fronds similar to H. villosum but indusia which bear crests on the outer surfaces similar to H. sanguinolentum. Plants of this description have been recorded from the Ruahine Forest Park (WELT P018742), Kaimanawa Forest Park (WELT P018741), Kaituna Valley, near Blenheim (CHR 46297), Kekerengu Range, Marlborough (CHR 387557), Blue Duck Reserve, Marlborough (CHR 387980), Port Hills, Christchurch (CHR 235775, 278448, 397939), Banks Peninsula (AK 278431, CHR 178338, 517421), Peel Forest (CHR 386696, 386702) and Tautuku Forest, Southland (CHR 403680). More rarely, plants lacking crests and having almost glabrous fronds have been recorded from Banks Peninsula (CHR 276234, WELT P000506, P005992), Alton Burn, Southland (CHR 403717) and near Dunedin (CHR 144311). It is possible that the plants of intermediate morphology correspond to the tetraploid forms of H. sanguinolentum. The voucher specimens from the Port Hills for Brownlie’s report of n = 72 (CHR 397939), and from near Akaroa for Large’s unpublished count of n = 72 (AK 278431), are both listed above. However, further work is needed to determine whether all plants of intermediate morphology are tetraploids. If that could be demonstrated, it is likely that they represent an undescribed allopolyploid species derived from hybridisation between diploid plants of H. sanguinolentum and H. villosum . Apart from two records in the Ruahine and Kaimanawa Ranges, all plants of intermediate morphology have been collected from the eastern or southern South Island.

"Hymenophyllum villosum Colenso, Tasmanian J. Nat. Sci. 2: 185 (1845)",,25-275mm-long,"Occurs in podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest, in mānuka, kānuka and subalpine scrub, and in tussock and alpine herbfield, growing on the ground, on rocks and banks, on rock faces, under overhangs, on fallen logs and as an epiphyte. It has been recorded on trunks and branches of Archeria traversii , Dacrycarpus dacrydioides , Dacrydium cupressinum , Griselinia littoralis , Ixerba brexioides , Metrosideros umbellata , Olearia chathamica , O. colensoi , Phyllocladus alpinus , Podocarpus laetus , P. totara , Pseudowintera colorata , Quintinia serrata , Weinmannia racemosa and species of Nothofagaceae . It has also been recorded from the trunk of Leptopteris , but not from any tree fern species. Recognition: Hymenophyllum villosum is a small to medium-sized filmy fern distinguished by its entire lamina margins, often black zig-zagged rachis, winged rachis and stipe, and hairy fronds. The fronds are often tightly coiled in exposed situations. Plants in the South Island generally have much hairier fronds and narrower ultimate segments (usually less than 1 mm wide) than those in the North Island which are sometimes only sparsely hairy. When dry it has a strong smell and stains paper dark 60brown or yellow. It is very similar to H. sanguinolentum , but is usually distinguished by its hairy fronds, narrower ultimate segments (0.4–1.2 mm wide cf. 0.8–1.5 mm wide), and indusial flaps which are usually about twice as long as broad and lack crests on their outer surfaces. The distinction between the two species is more obvious in the South Island where H. villosum is usually very hairy and has narrower ultimate segments. Hymenophyllum sanguinolentum generally grows at lower altitudes than H. villosum (0–900 vs 370–1300 m in the North Island; 0–850 vs 30–1650 m in the South Island). Nevertheless there is a significant zone of overlap and plants of both species occur together in several places. Hymenophyllum villosum grows frequently with H. multifidum and the two can be confused, especially when sterile or the fronds are tightly coiled. However, they can always be distinguished by the entire lamina margin in the former, and toothed margin in the latter. Cytology: n = 34 (Daellenbach 1982), 36 (Brownlie 1954). Notes: Hymenophyllum villosum was described by Colenso (1845) from collections he made in forests near Ruatāhuna in January 1842. The lectotype was chosen by Allan (1961), “WELT, near Ruatahuna, Colenso ” (now WELT P003273). There is also a specimen at K ( Colenso 288 ) which is a syntype (photo WELT E469/30).

Etymology: Either, from the Greek trichos (hair), and manes (a kind of cup), a reference to the hair- like receptacles exserted from the indusia; or trichos (hair), and manes (an extreme profusion), a reference to the conspicuous and persistent receptacles in the type species (Gardner 2014). Epiphytic, terrestrial or rupestral ferns. Rhizomes erect or short to long-creeping, filiform to rather thick, bearing dense multicellular light brown or red-brown or blackish hairs; roots absent or few and fine or numerous and robust. Fronds monomorphic. Laminae entire (not NZ) or 1–4-pinnatifid (NZ) or 1–3- pinnate (NZ) or 4–5-pinnate (not NZ), membranous and usually one cell thick, or with multistratose false veins present either side of true veins (not NZ), often translucent, glabrous or hairy; margins entire or shallowly lobed, sometimes a single row of elongate marginal cells forming a distinct border. Veins free. Sori terminating veins at margins of lamina. Indusia tubular to campanulate, widened or not at the mouth; receptacles long-exserted. Spores trilete, radially symmetrical, papillate to echinate. Taxonomy: Ebihara et al. (2006) recognised eight genera ( Abrodictyum , Callistopteris , Cephalomanes , Crepidomanes , Didymoglossum , Polyphlebium , Trichomanes and Vandenboschia ) within the trichomanoid clade, each with one to four subgenera. Of these, three ( Abrodictyum , Polyphlebium and Crepidomanes ) are represented in New Zealand. However, following Allan (1961) and Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth (2000), only one umbrella genus is accepted here in the interest of nomenclatural stability and because of the difficulty of distinguishing the three segregate genera morphologically. 1 Rhizomes erect ...................................................................................................................... 2 Rhizomes long-creeping ........................................................................................................ 3 2 Laminae narrowly elliptic, medium green; a single unbranched vein in each ultimate lamina segment ............................................................................................ strictum Laminae broadly triangular, dark olive-green; veins forking several times in each ultimate lamina segment ................................................................................ elongatum 623 Ultimate lamina segments lacking a distinct border .............................................................. 4 Ultimate lamina segments with a distinct border .................................................................... 5 4 Plants epiphytic; laminae light green; veins prominent, forking many times in each ultimate segment; sori sunk in lamina .............................................................. venosum Plants terrestrial or rupestral; laminae dark green; veins obscure, forking 1–2 times in each ultimate segment; sori stalked ............................................................ colensoi 5 Lamina border comprising short cells with transverse end-walls ............................ caudatum Lamina border comprising elongated cells with oblique end-walls .................................. 6 6 Lamina border unistratose; roots few and fine ................................................ endlicherianum Lamina border bistratose; roots absent ........................................................................ humile Distribution: A genus of about 260 species distributed in south temperate regions and montane areas of the tropics (Iwatsuki in Kramer & Green 1990). 7 species in New Zealand; 3 endemic.

The rhizomes in species of Trichomanes are abundantly covered in red-brown hairs, whereas those in Hymenophyllum are generally almost glabrous or bear only scattered hairs near the stipe bases.

"Trichomanes caudatum Brack., U.S. Expl. Exped., Filic. 16, 256, t. 36, f. 5 (1854)",,18-65mm-long,"Occurs as an epiphyte on Dicksonia squarrosa in lowland podocarp and broadleaved forest on a river terrace near Kerikeri, and on massive trunks of Cyathea milnei in wet Metrosideros forest at c. 450 m on Raoul Island. Recognition: Trichomanes caudatum is distinguished from T. elongatum and T. strictum by its epiphytic habit, creeping rhizome, lamina segments with a clearly defined border, and campanulate indusia which are widened at the mouth. It is superficially similar to, and occupies the same habitat as, T. venosum , but can be distinguished by its bordered lamina segments, obtuse apices which are never emarginate, and ultimate lamina segments with a single unbranched vein. It is also superficially similar to T. humile but can be distinguished by the unistratose border of short cells with transverse end-walls. Notes: In the classification of Ebihara et al. (2006), Trichomanes caudatum is treated as Abrodictyum caudatum . There are differences between the Kerikeri and Raoul plants. The fronds of the Kerikeri plants grow downwards against the substrate, whereas Raoul plants appear slightly more upright. The indusia are more obviously flared in the Kerikeri plants, whereas the very few present in the Raoul material appear to be more truncate. Also the plants on Raoul grow at a much higher altitude than those at Kerikeri. Whether the two populations belong to the same species is uncertain. Fronds of Trichomanes caudatum in New Zealand are much smaller and less divided than those in Australia or the Pacific. Nevertheless the cell structure of the lamina and the shape of the indusia suggest that they are correctly referred to this species. In Northland, the species is on the very southern edge of its distribution and the plants are probably poorly developed compared to those in tropical regions. DNA sequencing (Perrie et al. 2016) indicates that the Kerikeri plants group with those in Fiji, French Polynesia, and Australia. However, it also indicates that New Caledonian material of T. caudatum is different to that in Fiji, French Polynesia, and Australia, suggesting that more than one species may be present in the Pacific region. 64Fig. 145 : Trichomanes caudatum .

It frequently grows with T. endlicherianum and bryophyte species. Recognition: Trichomanes colensoi is similar in appearance and habitat to T. endlicherianum . It is distinguished by its very finely divided fronds, lack of a wing on the rachis, stalked pinnae, lamina segments lacking a border, and adnate or stalked indusia. It is distinguished from T. venosum by its non-epiphytic habitat, dark green frond, much finer ultimate segments, and lamina segments which are never emarginate. Cytology: n = 36 (Brownlie 1958).

"Trichomanes elongatum A.Cunn., Companion Bot. Mag. 2: 368 (1837)",,95-360mm-long,"Occurs on the ground, amongst roots, on banks and rocks, under overhangs and beside streams in dark, damp kauri, podocarp and broadleaved forest and in old mānuka and kānuka scrub. Recognition: Trichomanes elongatum is recognised by its erect rhizome, ovate or triangular dark olive-green laminae, lack of a wing on most of the rachis, broad and overlapping lamina segments with the veins forking several times in each, and conspicuous brown receptacles far-exserted beyond the indusial flaps. The laminae are often covered in epiphyllous mosses and liverworts. Notes: In the classification of Ebihara et al. (2006), Trichomanes elongatum is treated as Abrodictyum elongatum. Trichomanes elongatum was described by Cunningham (1837) citing a specimen from “Dark ravines in the forests of Wangaroa, etc. – 1834, R. Cunningham ”. Allan (1961) stated “Type: R. Cunningham , 1834, BM”. However, the only specimens in BM from Cunningham’s herbarium are labelled “Bay of Islands, New Zealand, May 1838” and “New Zealand, A. Cunningham”. Both of these are in conflict with the protologue, and hence Allan’s statement cannot be regarded as a lectotypification. Nevertheless, there is a specimen at K from Cunningham’s herbarium which is labelled “In damp woods of Wangaroa & Hokianga, R. Cunningham , 1834”. This specimen is the holotype (Brownsey & Perrie 2016). Croxall (1975) considered that Trichomanes elongatum (as Selenodesmium elongatum ) occurred in Queensland and New South Wales, although he conceded that the distinctions between it and S. dentatum (widespread in the Pacific) and S. obscurum (from Asia, Australia and the western Pacific) were far from clear. Bostock & Spokes (1998) recognised only the latter species in Australia (as Cephalomanes obscurum ), leaving Trichomanes elongatum as endemic to New Zealand. Nevertheless, the relationships between these three species are close and worthy of further investigation. Fig. 155 : Trichomanes elongatum .

"Trichomanes endlicherianum C.Presl, Gefässbündel Farrn, 25 (1847)",,22-130mm-long,"Occurs on damp rock, under overhangs, at the base of Rhopalostylis sapida trunks or occasionally on Dicksonia squarrosa , on the underside of fallen trunks, or beside streams in dark, wet, broadleaved forest, or rarely in beech forest. It often grows with Trichomanes colensoi and Loxogramme dictyopteris . Recognition: Trichomanes endlicherianum is similar in appearance and habitat to T. colensoi . It is distinguished by its less divided frond, winged stipe and rachis, adnate pinnae, lamina segments with a distinct border, and indusia immersed in the lamina. It is distinguished from T. venosum by its terrestrial habitat, dark green frond and ultimate segments with a single unbranched vein. It is superficially very similar to T. humile but can be distinguished by the presence of roots, the unistratose rather than bistratose border, and by the wing of laminal cells either side of the sori which are 3 or more cells wide at mid-length, rather than only 1–2 cells wide. Notes: In the classification of Ebihara et al. (2006), Trichomanes endlicherianum is treated as Polyphlebium endlicherianum. The name Trichomanes humile Forst.f., and combinations based on it, have been widely misapplied to this species in New Zealand, but both species are now known to occur on the Kermadec Islands. Copeland (1933), Allan (1961) and Brownlie (1977) included T. alternans Carruth. (type from Fiji), T. tenue Brack. (type from Tahiti) and T. erectum Brack. (type from Fiji) in synonymy with T. endlicherianum. However, some plants from Fiji and French Polynesia are very different genetically to New Zealand plants (Perrie et al. 2016). Plants from Fiji and Samoa are also morphologically different, having much narrower lamina segments, and indusia that are not immersed in the lamina, but plants from Tahiti are rather similar to those of New Zealand, Norfolk Island and Australia. The relationship of plants in New Zealand to those in the Pacific requires further investigation. 70Fig. 162 : Trichomanes endlicherianum .

"Trichomanes humile G.Forst., Fl. Ins. Austr., 84 (1786)",,25-35mm-long,"Occurs as an epiphyte on Cyathea milnei in dense, deeply shaded wet forest under Metrosideros kermadecensis at 450 m altitude. Recognition: Trichomanes humile is superficially similar to T. endlicherianum and T. caudatum but can be distinguished by its bistratose border of elongated cells, and sometimes by the absence of roots. Trichomanes caudatum has a border of shorter cells and T. endlicherianum a border of elongated cells, but neither are bistratose. Trichomanes humile is further distinguished by the wing of laminal cells either side of the sori which are only 1–2 cells wide at mid- length, whereas in T. endlicherianum they are 3 or more cells wide.

Occasionally it is found on Cyathea medullaris , Weinmannia racemosa or Melicytus ramiflorus trunks, on fallen trunks, damp banks, or on wet rock faces and overhangs. Recognition: Trichomanes venosum is distinguished by its epiphytic habitat, light green translucent fronds, and prominent veins which fork many times in each ultimate lamina segment. It is superficially similar to, and occupies the same habitat as, T. caudatum , but can be distinguished by its unbordered and emarginate lamina segments, and ultimate lamina segments with veins forking many times in each. Cytology: n = 36 (Brownlie 1954). Notes: In the classification of Ebihara et al. (2006), Trichomanes venosum is treated as Polyphlebium venosum .

New Zealand Inst. 7: 377, t. 25 (1875)",,25-450mm-long; 0.5-2.5mm; 3.5-10.5mm-wide,"Isoetes alpina usually occurs in montane lakes and tarns, growing submerged on mud, sand or rock substrates. Occasionally it is found in mud on lake margins, and rarely in streams. It has been recorded growing in water up to 5.5 m deep in L. Pōteriteri (CHR 502298) and up to 8.5 m deep in L. Wakatipu (CHR 478370). The NIWA Aquatic Plant Database has maximum depth records of 10 m in L. Tennyson, 12 m in L. Wānaka and 12.5 m in L. Coleridge (Paul Champion, pers. comm., July 2018). Recognition: Isoetes alpina is difficult to distinguish from I. kirkii , most characters overlapping in their range of variation. However, I. alpina is generally a more robust plant, producing tufts of up to 35 leaves, which can grow much longer and wider than in I. kirkii . The sporangia are also generally longer and wider than in I. kirkii . Isoetes alpina is best distinguished by the megaspores, which are grey to white in colour with a smooth surface, in contrast to those of I. kirkii , which are white and distinctly tuberculate on their surfaces (Large & Braggins 1991). Cytology: 2n = 22 (Marsden 1979) Notes: Isoetes alpina was first collected by F.W. Hutton and W.T.L. Travers from Lake Guyon in 1872, and then by Sven Berggren from Lake Pearson in 1874. It was subsequently described by Kirk (1875) from material sent to him by Travers. The principal point of difference noted by Kirk was the smooth surface of the macrospores, in contrast to the tuberculate macrospores of I. kirkii . 5Fig. 2 : Isoetes alpina .

It has been recorded in water up to 4.1 m deep in L. Taupō (Paul Champion, pers. comm., July 2018). Recognition: Isoetes kirkii is generally a smaller, more delicate plant producing tufts of up to 15 leaves, which are shorter and narrower than in I. alpina . The sporangia are also shorter and narrower. I. kirkii is best distinguished by the megaspores, which are white and distinctly tuberculate on their surfaces, in contrast to those of I. alpina , which are grey to white in colour with a smooth surface (Large & Braggins 1991). Cytology: 2n = 22 Marsden 1979). There are also unpublished reports of apomictic, tetraploid populations in L. Taupō and L. Rotoiti (see Hofstra et al. 2006). Notes: Isoetes was first collected in New Zealand in February 1869, when it was discovered by F.W. Hutton and Thomas Kirk in the Waikato Lakes region (Kirk 1875). Material was sent to J.D. Hooker at K (001094253), and to von Mueller in Melbourne. It was forwarded to A.C.H. Braun in Berlin, who described it as a new species (Braun 1869), named after Thomas Kirk. The only extant specimen at B collected prior to Braun’s publication is one collected by Kirk in the Waikato area and forwarded by von Mueller in 1869. It is presumed to be the holotype. The only other specimen known to have been collected in 1869 prior to Braun’s publication of I. kirkii is the specimen at K sent to Hooker, but this would not have been seen by Braun. Kirk returned to the Waikato in April 1870 and collected more material, but crucially this was after Braun’s description of the new species. Isoetes multiangularis was described by Colenso (1890) from material collected at Lake Taupō in 1889 by C.J. Norton. There is no original material in the Colenso herbaria at WELT, K or AK. There is a specimen in WELT (P003753), said to be from the Kirk herbarium, collected by Norton from Lake Taupō in 1889. This may be from the same gathering as the material sent to Colenso, but the specimen is not labelled I. multiangularis , and there is no evidence that Colenso saw it, so it cannot be regarded as original material. The identity of I. multiangularis is therefore uncertain. The name is included here, with considerable doubt, in the synonymy of I. kirkii solely on the basis of its geographic locality, but it could also be one of the apomictic populations thought to occur in the central North Island. The genetic results that link the South Island populations at Lake Paringa and Lake Ellery with North Island populations of I. kirkii (Hofstra & de Winton 2016) require further investigation. Populations from lakes in the northern South Island have not been sampled, and these areas may be critical for assessing any possible overlap between northern I. kirkii and southern I. alpina .

"Lindsaea linearis Sw., J. Bot. (Schrader)",50-500mm; 700mm-long,10-150mm-long; 12-380mm-long,"Lindsaea linearis is a terrestrial fern of poor soils, most frequently found growing under mānuka, kānuka, gorse or bracken, in grassland or sedgeland, but sometimes in kauri forest, or along tracks and on forest margins. It tolerates clay, peat, greywacke, gumland, pākihi, serpentine and ultramafic substrates, and is found on dry banks as well as in Sphagnum and peat bog. Recognition: Lindsaea linearis is recognised by its dimorphic fronds (the sterile prostrate and the fertile erect), linear pinnate laminae, and flabellate primary pinnae. The indusia extend along the 4margins of the pinnae and are strongly toothed. The fertile pinnae often droop and shrivel in the poor, dry soils that the plant can tolerate. Cytology: n = 34 (Brownlie 1958). This number is unique in the genus and the lowest recorded for Lindsaea (Lehtonen et al. 2010). Notes: The name Lindsaea lunata Willd. is a superfluous name, citing the earlier name, L. linearis Sw. in synonymy. The fact that L. linearis is not listed elsewhere by Willdenow (1810) indicates that he regarded it as a synonym, and that he was not simply comparing the two. Fig. 2 : Lindsaea linearis .

London 3: 43, t. 11 (1797)",,70-440mm-long,"Lindsaea trichomanoides is a terrestrial fern found under kauri, podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, or under mānuka and kānuka. It usually grows on the ground, or at the base of tree trunks, amongst tree roots, in litter or humus hummocks, on logs, on stream and track banks, or in damp gullies. Recognition: Lindsaea trichomanoides is recognised by its monomorphic fronds with red-brown stipes and rachises. The laminae are very variable in shape and dissection – usually 2-pinnate to 2 ‑pinnate-pinnatifid, but sometimes only 1-pinnate-pinnatifid or as much as 3-pinnate. The primary pinnae arise at a wide angle to the rachis and rarely overlap. The ultimate segments are ovate to obovate with obtuse or rounded apices. The indusia curve around the margins of the ultimate segments with the free margin more or less entire. Cytology: n = 42, 43 (Brownlie 1957, as Lindsaea cuneata ). Notes: The species was first recorded in New Zealand as Adiantum cuneatum (Forster 1786). However, the combination Lindsaea cuneata , made by Christensen (1905–1906) and used in earlier Floras, is preoccupied by L. cuneata (Willdenow 1810). The name L. lessonii Bory has frequently been used at varietal rank for pinnate forms of L. trichomanoides . However, Kramer & Tindale (1976) and Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth (2000) treated these forms as just part of the range of variation in L. trichomanoides . 7Lehtonen et al. (2010) found no DNA sequence differences between L. trichomanoides and L. rufa Kramer from New Caledonia (Kramer 1967). The two species are also very similar morphologically, and their relationship requires further investigation. Fig. 11 : Lindsaea trichomanoides .

It is an uncommon species, most frequently found above c. 100 m. Recognition: Lindsaea viridis is recognised by its monomorphic fronds, purple-brown stipes and rachises, and narrowly elliptic to narrowly ovate laminae that are 2-pinnate to 3-pinnate-pinnatifid. The primary pinnae arise at a narrow angle to the rachis and often overlap. The ultimate segments are narrowly obovate and truncate. The indusia are oblong or slightly wider than long, and straight rather than curved. Cytology: n = c. 88 (Brownlie 1961). Fig. 20 : Lindsaea viridis .

Filic., 271 (1852) Type taxon: Odontosoria uncinella (Kunze) Fée Etymology: From the Greek odonto - (toothed), and soros (sorus), a reference to the appearance of the sori. Terrestrial ferns. Rhizomes short- to long-creeping, scaly. Rhizome scales non-clathrate, narrowly ovate or trichome-like. Fronds monomorphic. Stipes pale brown, glabrous. Laminae 2–4-pinnate, herbaceous or coriaceous, glabrous. Veins free. Sori oblong or slightly extended laterally, superficial, marginal or submarginal; paraphyses present. Indusia always present, attached at base and sides, opening towards the margin. Spores monolete or trilete, perispores smooth or granulate. Taxonomy: As circumscribed by Lehtonen et al. (2010), Odontosoria includes many species that were previously treated in Sphenomeris . It remains poorly defined morphologically, albeit genetically distinct from the other genera of Lindsaeaceae. Distribution: A pantropical genus of more than 20 species (Kramer 1990; Lehtonen et al. 2010), with 12 in the Neotropics and the remainder in the Old World tropics and Pacific islands. Absent from Australia (Kramer 1990). One species casual in New Zealand. Biostatus: Exotic; casual. 11Table 3 : Number of species in New Zealand within Odontosoria Fée Category Number Exotic: Casual 1 Total 1 Recognition: In New Zealand, Odontosoria can be distinguished from species of Lindsaea by its pale brown stipes, 3–4-pinnate laminae, and sori that are usually oblong.

Huperzia australiana (Herter),,3-10mm-long; 0.8-1.4mm-wide,"Huperzia australiana grows terrestrially, often on stream banks, in podocarp and beech forest, under mānuka, Olearia and Dracophyllum scrub, in subalpine shrub and herbfield, in tussock grassland, on boulders, on rock outcrops and in crevices, on scree and cliffs, and in boggy ground. It occurs on greywacke, limestone, marble, ultramafic rock, and on a range of volcanic rock types. Recognition: Huperzia australiana is easily recognised by the presence of bulbils in the axils of the leaves, and is the only species of Lycopodiaceae in New Zealand that is bulbiferous. It is also distinguished by its upright, terrestrial habit, and by the absence of distinct strobili. Notes: The name Lycopodium selago L. used in many earlier New Zealand Flora treatments is a misidentification of Huperzia australiana. Allan (1961) made the superfluous new combination Lycopodium australianum (Herter) Allan, believing incorrectly that Herter’s original basionym was Urostachys australianus , rather than Lycopodium australianum. 5Fig. 2 : Huperzia australiana .

Phytotax. 18: 441 (1983) Type taxon: Lycopodiella inundata (L.) Holub Etymology: From the related genus Lycopodium and the Latin diminutive suffix - ellus. Terrestrial plants. Main stems indeterminate, horizontal and creeping or looping, giving rise to determinate, erect, simple or branched, aerial stems, often of different thickness to the horizontal stems. Roots arising at intervals along the length of horizontal stems. Leaves spirally arranged, usually all similar; leaf margins entire or minutely ciliate. Bulbils absent. Sporophylls modified and aggregated into distinct strobili, ephemeral. Strobili terminal on ultimate branches or lateral on overtopping branches, erect or pendent, sessile or stalked. Spores rugulate. Taxonomy: A genus of c. 54 species ( PPG 1 2016 , including all species in the subfamily Lycopodielloideae). Following Øllgaard (1987 , 1989 , 1990 ) the lycopodioid clade within Lycopodiaceae is interpreted here to include just two genera, Lycopodiella and Lycopodium . However, more recent classifications further subdivide these taxa into four and nine genera, respectively ( Field et al. 2016 ). The lycopodioid clade is distinguished by anisotomous branching, with dichotomies resulting in branches of unequal thickness; horizontal, indeterminate main stems that are creeping, looping or climbing, and give rise to aerial determinate branches; roots that arise at intervals along the length of the main stem; strongly modified sporophylls aggregated into strobili ( Øllgaard 1987 , 1990 ); and reticulate, baculate or rugulate spores ( Tryon & Lugardon 1991 , figs 229.1–12, 230.1–12; Large & Braggins 1991 ). Lycopodiella is distinguished from Lycopodium by its horizontal and subterranean, prostrate or looping stems, strobili that are terminal and either pendent and sessile, or erect on undivided stalks. In some species the strobili are lateral on overtopping branches. Spores are rugulate ( Tryon & Lugardon 1991 , figs 230.1–12; Large & Braggins 1991 ). In New Zealand, all species have spirally arranged leaves of one size. Four species of Lycopodiella (as circumscribed here) are present in New Zealand. In the classification of Field et al. (2016) , L. diffusa and L. lateralis would be placed in Lateristachys , L. cernua in Palhinhaea , and L. serpentina in Pseudolycopodiella . New Zealand species of Lycopodiella were included in Lycopodium by Allan (1961) . 71 Strobili mostly borne laterally on aerial stems, tan-brown, red-brown or chocolate-brown at maturity ....................................................................................................2 Strobili borne terminally on aerial stems and branches, yellow-brown at maturity ..................3 2 Aerial stems prostrate, 25–160 mm long; strobili red-brown or chocolate- brown at maturity ............................................................................................................ diffusa Aerial stems erect or scrambling upwards, 50–700 mm long; strobili tan- brown at maturity .......................................................................................................... lateralis 3 Horizontal stems looping across the ground; aerial stems branched many times, the ultimate branches curved downwards; strobili pendent or inclined downwards ...................................................................................................... cernua Horizontal stems prostrate, not looping; aerial stems unbranched, erect; strobili erect .............................................................................................................. serpentina Distribution: Lycopodiella is a genus of over 50 species occurring in moist temperate and tropical regions. The greatest diversity is in South America; four species in South Africa ( Roux 2009 ), five in Australia ( Chinnock 1998 ). Four indigenous, non-endemic species in New Zealand. Biostatus: Indigenous (Non-endemic). Table 3 : Number of species in New Zealand within Lycopodiella Holub Category Number Indigenous (Non-endemic) 4 Total 4 Cytology: Chromosome numbers in Lycopodiella are very variable. In sect. Lycopodiella (= Lycopodiella s.str. ) most counts are diploid with n = 78; in sect. Caroliniana (= Pseudolycopodiella ) n = 34, 35 and c. 69; and in sect. Campylostachys (= Palhinhaea ) counts of n = 104, 108, 110, 136, c. 165 have been reported ( Øllgaard 1987 , 1990 ). Notes: The type of Lepidotis was first designated by Rothmaler (1944) , who chose L. cernua (L.) P.Beauv. That choice was challenged by Pichi Sermolli (1971), who instead designated Lycopodium clavatum L., thereby making Lepidotis a synonym of Lycopodium , a view shared, among others, by Øllgaard ( 1989 , 2012 ). However, Greuter & Troia (2014) dismissed Pichi Sermolli’s arguments and asserted that Lepidotis is a legitimate name typified by L. cernua , stating that even if Rothmaler’s typification was disregarded, a subsequent typification by Fuchs (1955) could not be rejected. As a consequence, the name Palhinhaea (L.) Franco & Vasc. was made illegitimate because it was based on the previously designated type of Lepidotis. Greuter & Troia therefore proposed the conservation of Palhinhaea against Lepidotis to preserve the use of Palhinhaea and remove the threat to Lycopodiella , a proposal now accepted, leaving Lepidotis a rejected name under Lycopodiella.",,,,35-480mm-long; 4-18mm-wide,,,,,,Lycopodiaceae,"['indigenous', 'non-endemic']"
Lycopodiella cernua (L.),50-620mm; 30-270mm-wide; 10-140mm-long; 40-600mm-long,3-8mm-long; 0.4-0.8mm-wide,"Lycopodiella cernua grows terrestrially on track or roadside banks, on road cuttings and cliffs, on clay soils, on scoria, in gumland, on stabilised dunes, under mānuka, kānuka or Dracophyllum scrub, occasionally under rātā forest, and most abundantly in thermal areas on the edges of steam vents, hot springs and streams or steaming lakes. Recognition: Lycopodiella cernua is easily recognised by its looping horizontal stems; its dendroid aerial stems that arise on the looping stems between rooting points; its ultimate branches, which tend to curl downwards; and its pendent strobili. Cytology: 2n = c. 200 ( de Lange et al. 2004 ). Notes: The combinations Lycopodium cernuum var. curvatum (Sw.) Nessel, Bärlappgewächse 354 (1939) and L. cernuum var. vulcanicum (Blume) Nessel, Bärlappgewächse 354 (1939), based in part on New Zealand material, are almost certainly misidentifications. The types of L. curvatum Sw. and L. vulcanicum Blume are from Jamaica and Java, respectively. Nessel (1939) made almost 40 spurious varieties and forms in L. cernuum which, although unhelpful nomenclaturally, did indicate the range of morphological variation in this species. Burnard et al. (2016) detected three different haplotypes in populations of Lycopodiella cernua from New Zealand, New Caledonia, Fiji, Malaysia, Japan and USA. The New Zealand specimens were identical to that from Japan but different to those from elsewhere. Burnard et al. (2016) suggested that different lineages may be adapted to temperate and tropical habitats. The species also exhibits morphological variation in the hairiness of the branches ( Zhang & Iwatsuki 2013 ) and needs further investigation. 9Fig. 11 : Lycopodiella cernua .

Lycopodiella diffusa (R.Br.),25-170mm-long; 20-250mm-wide,2.5-6.0mm-long; 0.5-1.1mm-wide,"Lycopodiella diffusa forms prostrate mats on pākihi or sandy soils, in mossy turf, on boggy ground, at the edge of tarns and on granite pavement, often with Juncus and Empodisma spp., or under Gleichenia , low mānuka, kānuka, epacrid or subalpine scrub. Recognition: Lycopodiella diffusa is distinguished from all other species of Lycopodiaceae in New Zealand, except L. lateralis , by its strobili usually being borne laterally on the aerial stems, and characteristically chocolate-brown at maturity. The aerial stems grow prostrate with only the ends of the branches upturned, branching dichotomously up to five times. In L. lateralis the aerial stems are held erect or scramble upwards, and are generally much longer than in L. diffusa (50–600 mm, cf. 25–170 mm tall). The leaves of L. diffusa are generally incurved, and slightly shorter and wider than in L. lateralis (2.5–6.0 mm long, 0.5–1.1 mm wide; cf. 3.5–9.0 mm long, 0.3–0.9 mm wide). Notes: Burnard et al. (2016) detected several haplotypes in Lycopodiella diffusa and L. lateralis , but they did not correspond to the two different morphologies. Three samples with L. lateralis morphology shared the haplotype found in L. diffusa. Whether this is evidence of hybridisation between the two taxa or a result of ancestral polymorphism is unclear.

Lycopodiella lateralis (R.Br.),50-700mm; 35-200mm-wide,3.5-9mm-long; 0.3-0.9mm-wide,"Lycopodiella lateralis grows on gumland, serpentine, pākihi, sand and other poor soils, in Sphagnum bog, on peat or swampy ground with Gleichenia , Juncus and Empodisma spp., and sometimes in ditches, on damp rock faces or clay banks. It occurs in tussock, under mānuka, kānuka, Dracophyllum and low broadleaved scrub, and sometimes extends into podocarp or broadleaved forest.  Recognition: Lycopodiella lateralis is distinguished from all other species of Lycopodiaceae in New Zealand, except L. diffusa , by its strobili being borne laterally on the aerial stems, and in being characteristically chocolate-brown at maturity. The aerial stems grow erect, or scramble upwards through other vegetation, branching dichotomously up to four times, while the horizontal stems are subterranean. In L. diffusa ​​​​​​, the aerial stems are prostrate, with only the ends of the branches upturned, and are generally much shorter than in L. lateralis (25–170 mm, cf. 50–700 mm tall). The leaves of L. lateralis are generally spreading or reflexed, and slightly longer and narrower than in L. diffusa (3.5–9.0 mm long, 0.3–0.9 mm wide; cf. 2.5–6.0 mm long, 0.5–1.1 mm wide).

Lycopodiella serpentina (Kunze),15-140mm,2.5-5.0mm-long; 0.4-1.0mm-wide,"Lycopodiella serpentina grows firmly appressed to the ground in boggy areas, on peat, in poorly drained paddock, in gumland, and on sandy soils, often with Sphagnum and Empodisma or under stunted mānuka or Gleichenia . Recognition: Lycopodiella serpentina is distinguished by its appressed, prostrate, horizontal stems that root at intervals, and its unbranched aerial stems that terminate in solitary, unbranched strobili. The sterile leaves are also distinctive in having an ascending habit on the horizontal stems, but appressed or spreading on the aerial stems. Notes: The name Lycopodium carolinianum L. used in 19th century New Zealand Flora treatments is a misidentification of Lycopodiella serpentina. Øllgaard (1987) included both Lycopodiella serpentina and L. caroliniana within section Caroliniana (= Pseudolycopodiella Holub). However, Burnard et al. (2016) did not recover these two species as a clade, suggesting that some of the distinguishing morphological characters must be homoplastic within Lycopodiella , and that the current classification needs revision. 16Fig. 34 : Lycopodiella serpentina .

It often grows in extensive colonies, either on swampy ground or under dry scrub. It is occasionally found in Eucalyptus plantations. Recognition: Lycopodium deuterodensum is recognised by its dendroid aerial stems, which arise from subterranean horizontal stems; its ultimate branches, which are either erect or curl upwards; and its strobili, which are erect or ascending.

Holland. 165 (1810)",20-520mm-long; 10-210mm-wide; 5-240mm-long; 25-380mm-long,,"Lycopodium fastigiatum grows terrestrially in open podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest, under mānuka, in Dracophyllum and Olearia scrub, on forest margins, on road or river banks, in tussock grassland, in subalpine shrubland, herbfield and bog, and in rock crevices and open rocky ground. It occurs on greywacke, limestone and a variety of volcanic rock types. Recognition: Lycopodium fastigiatum is recognised by its much-branched and diverging aerial stems bearing linear, incurved leaves, and strobili that are solitary or borne in clusters of two or three at the end of sparsely leaved stalks. It is distinguished from L. deuterodensum by its stalked rather than sessile strobili, and from L. scariosum and L. volubile by its diverging aerial stems with monomorphic leaves rather than flattened aerial stems with dimorphic leaves. Cytology: 2n = 60 ( Murray & de Lange 2013 ). Notes: Lycopodium decurrens was described by Colenso (1896) , but is illegitimate because of an earlier homonym ( Brown 1810 ). It has traditionally been included in the synonymy of L. fastigiatum (Cheeseman 1906 , 1925 ; Allan 1961 ) but no specimens of this taxon are extant in AK, K or WELT, and its identity remains uncertain. Lycopodium cochinchinense was described by Nessel (1940) from material said to have been collected in Cochinchina and from Rotorua, New Zealand. Øllgaard ( 1987 , 1989 ) treated it as a synonym of L. fastigiatum and designated the specimen from Cochinchina as the lectotype, although he said it was probably mislabelled. Lycopodium fastigiatum occurs only in New Zealand and Australia. The name Lycopodium magellanicum P.Beauv ., and combinations based on it, as used in earlier New Zealand Floras, are misidentifications of L. fastigiatum , but Lycopodium magellanicum var. berggrenii Herter ex Nessel is based on a New Zealand type and treated as a synonym of L. fastigiatum by Øllgaard (1987) . The holotype was collected by Berggren from Omatangi, Taupō, in 1875 ( Nessel 1940 ). Lycopodium fastigiatum var. colensoi Nessel was originally described from New South Wales and from Jacksons, Arthur’s Pass, New Zealand ( Nessel 1939 ), but the description was invalid because no Latin diagnosis was provided. Nessel (1940) later validly described the variety, citing only the holotype collected by von Mueller from New South Wales (with specimens in K, P, W and Herb. Boissier), with no mention of the New Zealand specimen. The name is therefore based on an Australian type and not included in the synonymy here. 22Fig. 48 : Lycopodium fastigiatum .

Phlegmariurus Holub, Preslia 36: 17, 21 (1964) Type taxon: Phlegmariurus phlegmaria (L.) T.Sen & U.Sen Etymology: From Phlegmaria , the epithet of the type species, and the Greek oura (tail), a reference to the fertile part of these plants that are in the form of a long tail (Pichi Sermolli 1971). Vernacular name: tassel ferns Terrestrial or epiphytic plants. Stems erect or pendent, dichotomously branched with branches of equal thickness, lacking horizontal stems. Roots forming a single basal tuft. Leaves spirally arranged, similar or gradually reducing towards the apex; leaf margins entire. Bulbils absent. Sporophylls similar to the leaves or slightly modified, aggregated into more or less distinct strobili, persistent. Strobili terminal on ultimate branches, pendent on epiphytic plants or curved downwards in erect plants, sessile. Spores foveolate or fossulate, triangular in polar view with convex lateral margins, and foveolate sculpture only on the distal surfaces. Taxonomy: A genus of c. 250 species ( PPG 1 2016 ). The huperzioid clade within Lycopodiaceae includes Huperzia , Phlegmariurus and Phylloglossum (Field et al. 2016 ). Previously Huperzia and Phlegmariurus were combined in a single genus ( Øllgaard 1987 ), or sometimes included also with Phylloglossum (Christenhusz et al. 2011 ). However, more recent studies have concluded that Phlegmariurus is distinct from Huperzia , and that three genera 29should be recognised ( Øllgaard 2012 ; Field & Bostock 2013 ; Field et al. 2016 ). New Zealand species of Huperzia and Phlegmariurus were all treated in Lycopodium by Allan (1961) . The huperzioid clade is distinguished by isotomous branching, with all dichotomies resulting in equally thick branches; tufted roots; sporophylls that are either similar to the leaves, or modified, aggregated into strobili and persistent ( Øllgaard 1987 , 1990 ; Field et al. 2016 ); and foveolate or fossulate spores (Tryon & Lugardon 1991 , figs 227.1–227.14; Large & Braggins 1991 ). Phlegmariurus is distinguished from Huperzia by lacking reproductive bulbils in the sporophyll axils (Øllgaard 1987 , fig. 22), having sporophylls that are aggregated into strobili (at least in New Zealand), and spores with convex lateral margins, and foveolate sculpture only on the distal surfaces ( Tryon & Lugardon 1991 , figs 227.5–227.14). They are either epiphytic pendent plants, or erect terrestrial or rupestral plants ( Field et al. 2016 ). Phlegmariurus is easily distinguished from Phylloglossum, which is a tiny terrestrial plant with a subterranean tuber, a whorl of linear leaves, and a small strobilus borne on a leafless stalk. Allan (1961) recognised three species in Lycopodium that are here included in Phlegmariurus: L. billardierei , L. novozealandicum and L. varium. However, Brownsey et al. (1985) reduced these to one polymorphic species requiring further investigation. Morphological and molecular analysis of this group by Perrie et al. (2020) has shown that Phlegmariurus billardierei is clearly distinct from P. varius and endemic to New Zealand, but that Colenso’s Lycopodium novozealandicum is just one form of Phlegmariurus varius . Terrestrial and epiphytic forms of P. varius , which were originally recognised as distinct varieties ( Brown 1810 ), are very closely related, and treated here as one species. They occur in Australia as well as New Zealand. 1 Transition from leaf to sporophyll abrupt, strobili distinct; stems (including leaves) 1.5–8 mm wide just before junction with strobilus; longest sporophylls 1.5–3 mm long; strobili 1.5–3 mm wide at widest point ........................ billardierei Transition from leaf to sporophyll gradual, strobili indistinct at proximal end; stems (including leaves) 6–18 mm wide just before junction with strobilus; longest sporophylls 2.5–11 mm long; strobili 3–17 mm wide at widest point ...................................................................................................................... varius Distribution: A large genus found mainly in the tropics and subtropics but with some species extending into the southern temperate zones ( Field et al. 2016 ); nine species in Australia ( Chinnock 1998 ).

Phlegmariurus billardierei (Spring),,1.5-8.0mm-wide; 12-30mm-long; 1.2-3.0mm-wide; 3.5-8mm-long; 0.6-1.2mm-wide,"Phlegmariurus billardierei occurs most commonly as an epiphyte in kauri, podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest, or under mature mānuka and kānuka. It has been recorded growing epiphytically on a variety of forest trees and climbers including Beilschmiedia tarairi , Cordyline sp., Dacrydium cupressinum , Dysoxylum spectabile , Griselinia littoralis , Knightia excelsa , Kunzea spp. , Melicytus ramiflorus , Metrosideros excelsa , M. fulgens , M. kermadecensis , M. robusta , Nestegis montana , Olearia traversiorum , Podocarpus totara , Rhopalostylis sapida , Vitex lucens , Weinmannia racemosa and species of Nothofagaceae , often hanging from clumps of Astelia . It has occasionally been recorded on Cyathea dealbata and Dicksonia squarrosa , but is generally not found on tree ferns (unlike P. varius ). Sometimes it occurs on the ground, on banks, on rock overhangs, in rock crevices, or at the base of trees. Recognition: Phlegmariurus billardierei is usually a pendent epiphytic species, but occasionally grows terrestrially on banks, on rock overhangs or in rock crevices. The stem divides dichotomously into branches of equal thickness and produces a basal tuft of roots. The sporophylls are smaller than the sterile leaves and aggregated into distinct 4-angled strobili. Phlegmariurus billardierei can be distinguished from P. varius by its generally longer and more divided stems, but most obviously by its strobili. These are distinct from the sterile leaves and clearly defined, unlike those in P. varius ​​​​​​, where the transition from leaf to sporophyll is gradual. The longest sporophylls are shorter (1.5–3 mm, cf. 2.5–11 mm long), and the strobili are narrower at their widest point (1.5–3 mm, cf. 3–17 mm wide). The stem (including the leaves) is generally much narrower just before the junction with the strobili than in P. varius ​​​​​ (1.5–8 mm, cf. 6–18 mm wide). A fastigiate form is occasionally found. Cytology: Unknown, but see under Phlegmariurus varius . 31Notes: The names Lycopodium flagellaria Bory and L. phlegmaria L., and combinations based on them, used in early New Zealand Flora treatments are misidentifications of Phlegmariurus billardierei. Lycopodium billardierei was described by Spring (1841) from a plant collected at the Bay of Islands. It was transferred to Phlegmariurus by Perrie et al. (2020) Perrie et al. (2020) segregated Phlegmariurus billardierei from P. varius ​​​​​​​ using morphological and genetic evidence. The two species are sympatric in New Zealand. Fig. 75 : Phlegmariurus billardierei .

Phlegmariurus varius (R.Br.),,6-18mm-wide; 10-19mm-long; 1-3mm-wide; 4.5-10mm-long; 0.8-2.6mm-wide,"Terrestrial forms of Phlegmariurus varius occur on the ground, on banks, on rock outcrops and rock faces, in rock crevices, in scrub or tussock, on boggy ground, or on fallen logs. The species also occurs as an epiphyte in podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, or under mature mānuka. It has been recorded growing epiphytically on Cyathea medullaris , C. smithii , Dicksonia fibrosa , D. squarrosa , Elaeocarpus sp., Fuchsia excorticata , Griselinia littoralis , Metrosideros umbellata , Olearia colensoi , Prumnopitys taxifolia , Weinmannia racemosa , Vitex lucens , species of Nothofagaceae , and hanging from clumps of Astelia . It is unlike P. billardierei in occurring quite frequently on tree fern trunks. Recognition: As its name suggests, Phlegmariurus varius is a variable species that either grows erect on the ground and on rock outcrops, or is a pendent epiphytic species. The stem divides dichotomously into stems of equal thickness and produces a basal tuft of roots. The leaves are similar to the sporophylls and grade imperceptibly into strobili that are either rather poorly distinguished and sometimes slightly bilaterally flattened, or clearly defined and 4-angled at their distal ends but poorly distinguished at their proximal ends. In terrestrial plants, the strobili are often curled downwards towards the ground. By contrast, the strobili of P. billardierei are well defined and characteristically 4- angled throughout. The longest sporophylls in P. varius are generally longer than in P. billardierei (2.5–11 mm, cf. 1.5–3 mm long), and the strobili are wider at their widest point (3–17 mm, cf. 1.5–3 mm wide). The stem (including the leaves) is generally much wider just before the junction with the strobili than in P. billardierei (6–18 mm, cf. 1.5–8 mm wide). Cytology: 2n = 256 ( Murray & de Lange 2013 – as Huperzia varia ). The voucher specimen (AK 303460) is sterile and could be either Phlegmariurus varius or P. billardierei . Notes: Lycopodium varium was described by Brown (1810) from specimens he collected in Tasmania. The species included two infraspecific taxa denoted as α umbrosum and β alpinum , now var. umbrosum and var. alpinum , respectively . Brown did not mention the autonym var. varium , but this was automatically created with the valid publication of the two infraspecific taxa, and is taken as the α epithet (see Mabberley & Moore , in press). The epithet α umbrosum is superfluous and therefore illegitimate. Brown did not identify a holotype for L. varium , but Chinnock (1998) designated R. Brown Iter Austral. 124 from Table Mountain (BM 001038064) as the lectotype. However this is labelled “β alpinum ” and refers to L. varium var. alpinum (see Mabberley & Moore , in press). The lectotype for L. varium is Robert Brown Iter Austral. 123 ( BM 001079913), cited in error by Chinnock as 124. The name Lycopodium mirabile , based on a collection by Labillardière from Australia, was published by Willdenow (1810) two months before Brown’s L. varium. Strict application of the Code requires replacement of the well-known name L. varium Brown by L. mirabile (Willd.). However, Field & 35Brownsey (2019) proposed conservation of L. mirabile with a conserved type so that its use is maintained for an Asian species to which it has consistently been applied, and the basionym L. varium is retained for the Australasian species.  The long-overlooked name Lycopodium pachystachyum Desv. is a synonym of P. varius based on an Australian type, whereas Kirk’s L. varium var. polaris and var. gracile, Nessel’s Urostachys helmii, and Colenso’s Lycopodium novae-zealandicum are all based on New Zealand types . The latter name, which was used by Allan (1961) , is an orthographic error that must be corrected to L. novozealandicum (Webb & Edgar 1999 ). The number of synonyms for Phlegmariurus varius is a reflection of the morphological variation in the species. Perrie et al. (2020) segregated Phlegmariurus billardierei from P. varius using morphological and genetic evidence. The two species are sympatric in New Zealand. Perrie et al. (2020) found no morphological or genetic evidence to further sub-divide P. varius despite its morphological variability. Fig. 84 : Phlegmariurus varius .

Zeitung (Berlin) 1: 721 (1843) Type taxon: Phylloglossum drummondii Kunze Etymology: From the Greek phyllon (leaf) and glossa (tongue), a reference to the shape of the leaves. Terrestrial plants. Stems erect, unbranched, growing from a subterranean tuber. Roots forming a single basal tuft. Leaves whorled at ground level, terete, linear. Bulbils absent. Sporophylls markedly different to the leaves, aggregated into distinct strobili, ephemeral. Strobili solitary, erect, terminal on leafless stalk. Spores foveolate or fossulate, triangular in polar view with convex lateral margins, and foveolate sculpture only on the distal surfaces. Taxonomy: A monotypic genus ( PPG 1 2016 ). Phylloglossum is a highly specialised genus which has been recognised for over 150 years. It belongs to the huperzioid clade of Lycopodiaceae (Field et al. 2016 ) but is morphologically distinct from both Huperzia and Phlegmariurus . It is a tiny terrestrial plant with a subterranean tuber, a basal rosette of linear leaves, and a small strobilus borne on a leafless stalk, quite unlike any other member of the family. Distribution: A monotypic genus confined to Australia and New Zealand, where it is adapted to seasonally wet conditions, surviving the dry season as an underground tuber. One indigenous, non- endemic species in New Zealand. Biostatus: Indigenous (Non-endemic).

It is an ephemeral species, appearing above ground only in winter and early spring. It grows from an underground tuber and is distinguished by a basal rosette of linear leaves, and an unbranched, leafless stalk that bears a single short strobilus.

Recognition: This species is easily recognised by its very large fronds growing from a low, compact rhizome. The laminae are always bipinnate, with swellings (pulvini) at the junctions of the primary pinnae and rachis. The sporangia are characteristically fused into synangia and open by lengthwise slits, unlike any other fern in New Zealand. In dry conditions, water is lost preferentially from the pulvini causing the pinnae to droop vertically in dramatic fashion. Ptisana salicina has been confused with P. oreades (Domin) Murdock, which is endemic to eastern Queensland and readily distinguished by a prickly stipe. It is also closely related to P. smithii (Mett. ex Kuhn) Murdock from Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, which generally has more deeply serrate pinnules, especially in juvenile fronds, and synangia that are 2–4 mm from the margin. P. howeana (W.R.B.Oliv.) Murdock, endemic to Lord Howe Island, has longer synangia with 15–22 pairs of sori, and secondary pinnae that are glabrous on the underside (Green 1994). Cytology: n = 39 (Brownlie 1961). Notes: Ptisana salicina was previously thought to be confined to New Zealand and Norfolk Island (Green 1994; Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth 2000). However, Murdock (2008a) reduced Marattia stokesii E.D.Br., M. cincta Copel. and M. grantii Copel. to synonymy and extended the distribution of P. salicina to include New Caledonia, the Cook Islands and French Polynesia. However, he conceded that it “likely encompasses several distinct taxa”. New Zealand plants were widely misidentified in earlier literature as Marattia fraxinea Sm., but that species is now believed to be confined to Africa, Madagascar, the Indian Ocean and India (Murdock 2008a). Ptisana salicina , or para, was cultivated by Māori, and the large stipules on the rhizome were considered a delicacy (Crowe 1981). The species is cultivated in many botanic gardens in New Zealand where it frequently grows much larger than any known plants in the wild. 4Fig. 2 : Ptisana salicina : mature frond.

Cheeseman (1925) and Allan (1961) both accepted P. novae-zealandiae as an endemic species. However, Large & Braggins (1989) compared the morphology of P. americana , P. novae-hollandiae and P. novae- zealandiae and concluded that they were extremely similar. Nagalingum et al. (2008) investigated the phylogenetic relationships of these species using five different gene markers. They concluded that there was no sequence divergence between P. novae-hollandiae and P. novae-zealandiae and that the two were conspecific. The name P. novae-hollandiae has nomenclatural priority and is therefore adopted here for the New Zealand plant. Kirk used the name P. novae zealandiae for his new species, but Webb & Edgar (1999) suggested that the specific epithet should take a hyphen.

Nephrolepis brownii (Desv.),240-1220mm-long; 100mm-long,300-1830mm-long; 100mm-long; 30-285mm-wide; 7-17mm-wide,"Nephrolepis brownii occurs in open ground, mostly in coastal and low-altitude forest, in shrubland, in clearings and around old cultivation sites, on banks and road margins, among boulders, and around thermal vents, forming “large, dense, almost pure stands” (Sykes 1977). On rich soil in the Denham Bay area it is said to reach 2 m in height (Sykes 1977), but in fernland near the coast it is more stunted. Recognition: Nephrolepis brownii is distinguished from N. cordifolia and N. flexuosa by its longer pinnae (34–155 mm long, cf. 9–53 mm long), which are abundantly covered in scales on both surfaces and bear multicellular hairs on the costae. The sori are longer than in the other species (1–1.5 cf. 0.5–1 mm), and the indusia are reniform with narrow sinuses. It is distinguished from N. exaltata by its shining appressed rhizome scales; by its sterile pinnae, which are auricled acroscopically; and by the pinna margins, which are irregularly serrate or lobed rather than minutely serrate. The species occurs in New Zealand only on the Kermadec Islands and does not naturally reach the North Island, though it is occasionally cultivated there. On the Kermadec Islands occasional stunted plants are found around fumaroles, and these have fronds with much smaller dimensions. Cytology: 2n = 82 (de Lange et al. 2004 – as N. hirsutula ) 4Notes: This species was widely misidentified as Nephrolepis exaltata (L.) Schott by earlier New Zealand authors, including Allan (1961), and as N. hirsutula (G.Forst.) C.Presl by authors since Sykes (1977). It is very similar to N. hirsutula and the two species occur together in much of south-east Asia and the tropical Pacific (Hovenkamp & Miyamoto 2005). Fig. 2 : Nephrolepis brownii .

Nephrolepis cordifolia (L.),240-1020mm-long; 30-100mm-wide,260-1130mm-long,"Nephrolepis cordifolia is now a serious environmental weed that occurs not only around current or former sites of human habitation, and on the sides of roads or railways, but also in urban forest remnants and coastal forest. It is common on scoria banks and rough lava, but also on rock walls, the sides of buildings, among boulders and under open pōhutukawa, mānuka, kānuka, Eucalyptus and pine, sometimes on thermally heated soil.

"Nephrolepis flexuosa Colenso, Trans. & Proc. New Zealand Inst. 20: 231 (1888)",170-620mm-long; 18-50mm-wide; 55mm-wide,200-750mm-long,"On Raoul Island, Nephrolepis flexuosa is abundant throughout the main forest associations of the island, as well as in shrubland and around fumaroles, on banks, at the base of old slips, along roads and tracksides, on boulders and cliff faces, and commonly as an epiphyte (Sykes 1977; P.J. de Lange pers. comm.). In the North Island it is found on thermally heated ground, beside hot streams and springs, and on steaming cliffs. It is also occasionally found as an epiphyte on Pinus radiata . Recognition: Nephrolepis flexuosa is an indigenous species, which is very similar to the naturalised N. cordifolia . It is distinguished by the absence of tubers on its long-creeping runners, by its less obviously scaly rhizomes and stipe bases, and by its generally shorter and narrower laminae (170–620 mm long, 18–50 mm wide, cf. 240–1020 mm long, 30–100 mm wide). The rhizome scales are also shorter and much narrower (3–5 mm long, 0.2–0.5 mm wide, cf. 5.5–7 mm long, 0.9–1.7 mm wide), with entire rather than lacerate bases. Nephrolepis flexuosa is a tetraploid species (2n = 164) and has larger spores than the diploid N. cordifolia (36–38.5 μm long, 23–25 μm wide, cf. 28–33 μm long, 18–22 μm wide). It is distinguished from both N. brownii and N. exaltata by its usually lunulate, rather than reniform, indusia. Cytology: n = 82, 2n = 164 (de Lange et al. 2004; de Lange et al. 2005). Notes: This species was first recorded in New Zealand by Hooker (1864) as Nephrolepis tuberosa (Bory) C.Presl based on specimens collected by Hochstetter and Sinclair from “hot springs near Waikati”. Colenso (1888) later described his N. flexuosa from hot streams at Tapuaeharuru and hot springs at Wairakei, convinced that it was different to N. tuberosa as described and illustrated from overseas localities by earlier authors. However, Cheeseman (1906) referred all New Zealand material, including Colenso’s species, to N. cordifolia (L.) C.Presl. He cited collections from thermal sites in the North Island, adding Raoul Island only in the second edition of his Manual (Cheeseman 1925). Allan (1961) used the same name but provided no further information. Crookes (1963) stated that N. cordifolia was “found only in the thermal district”. However, she also noted that “it is easily cultivated and indeed flourishes as a garden escape … it is likely that these vigorous ferns derive, in many cases, from imported, cultivated specimens, but I do not have precise information on the subject”. This was the first suggestion that there might be two forms of the species in New Zealand, which was followed by Chinnock (in Heath & Chinnock 1974), who recorded the presence of an adventive species “common around Auckland and other centres” that was larger than the thermal species and bore small, potato-like tubers. The two forms were referred to different species by Brownsey et al. (1985) and illustrated by Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth (1989), but the thermal species remained without a formal name until de Lange et al. (2005) reinstated Colenso’s N. flexuosa as an indigenous species distinct from the introduced N. cordifolia . Hovenkamp & Miyamoto (2005) published their review of Nephrolepis world-wide at about the same time. They recognised three varieties of N. cordifolia and specifically stated that the native species of Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth (1989) was the same as their N. cordifolia var. cordifolia . However, in our opinion, the morphological and cytological characters detailed above are sufficient to recognise N. flexuosa as a species distinct from N. cordifolia . 10How far N. flexuosa extends beyond New Zealand is unclear. It has been reported from Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island and Fiji by de Lange et al. (2005), and from the Cook Islands by Sykes (2016). Hovenkamp & Miyamoto (2005) described a very similar entity as N. cordifolia var. pseudolauterbachii from Vanuatu, Fiji and Samoa, differing from the type in having smaller fronds and sinuose fertile pinnae, both characters that are associated with N. flexuosa . However, sequence data from Fijian material (L.R. Perrie unpub.) suggest that at least some plants are more similar to N. lauterbachii , otherwise only known from Papua New Guinea, the Moluccas and Solomon Islands (Hovenkamp & Miyamoto 2005). The identity of the species occurring in Fiji and other south-west Pacific islands therefore requires further investigation. The possibility that the variety described from Queensland by Domin (1913) as N. radicans var. cavernicola belongs to N. flexuosa also needs further investigation. Andrews (1990) and Bell (1998) both characterised it as a non-tuberous form related to N. cordifolia . Fig. 16 : Nephrolepis flexuosa .

"Botrychium australe R.Br., Prodr. Fl. Nov. Holland., 164 (1810)",,50-600mm-long,"Botrychium australe is a plant of disturbed habitats, occurring under mānuka, kānuka and matagouri scrub and broadleaved forest, and in open areas on river flats, track sides, in bush clearings, frost flats and around bush margins, in grassy areas, peat bog, herbfield and in reverting pasture. Plants occur singly or in large patches, but populations are often widely separated; they die down completely in winter, emerging again in spring from the underground rhizome. Braggins (1980) noted that the contractile roots may aid survival in exposed sites and that the fleshy roots provide a reservoir of starch, enabling plants to regrow after damage to the frond. Recognition: Botrychium australe is very similar to B. biforme in overall shape and size but is distinguished by its slightly less divided frond, and by the ultimate segments which are broader (1.3–5 mm wide) and acute or obtuse compared to those of B. biforme which are narrower (0.2–1 mm wide) and acuminate. Both species have green and bronze colour forms, and have large fleshy roots containing starch, but only in B. australe are they ridged and contractile (Braggins 1980). 4Cytology: n = 45 (Brownlie 1958); 2n = 90 (Braggins 1980; de Lange et al. 2004).

"Botrychium biforme Colenso, Trans. & Proc.

It is more tolerant of shade and has a more southerly distribution than B. australe . Plants occur singly or in large patches, but populations are often widely separated; they die down completely in winter, emerging again in spring from the underground rhizome. Recognition: Botrychium biforme is very similar to B. australe in overall shape and size.

Botrychium lunaria (L.),,22-85mm-long,"Occurs in short herbfield and in or around sinkholes in subalpine or alpine areas. Recognition: Botrychium lunaria is distinguished from the other two species in New Zealand by its much smaller stature, its pinnate sterile frond and its alpine habitat. Notes: New Zealand plants of this species are very small and their relationship to generally larger overseas plants, particularly from the northern hemisphere, requires further investigation. Fig. 18 : Botrychium lunaria . Mature plants with fertile and sterile laminae. Ophioglossum L., Sp. Pl., 1062 (1753) Type taxon: Ophioglossum vulgatum L. Etymology: From the Greek ophis (serpent), and glossa (tongue), a reference to the appearance of the fertile spike. Vernacular name: adder's tongue fern Terrestrial (NZ) or sometimes epiphytic (not NZ) ferns. Rhizomes erect, glabrous; roots fleshy, not contractile, sometimes proliferous but lacking buds and gemmae. Fronds convolute, divided into a sterile photosynthetic blade and a reduced spore-bearing portion (sporophore), 1 or 2 produced per season. Common stalk glabrous or with occasional hairs. Sterile blade undivided, herbaceous or fleshy, glabrous or with occasional hairs. Veins reticulate. Sporophore undivided. Sporangia not in sori, deeply sunken in two rows on either side of the sporophore. Spores trilete, cream-white, coarsely to finely verrucate. Taxonomy: A genus of 30–50 species, depending on authority. Brownsey et al. (1985) noted that “Ophioglossum is a taxonomically difficult genus in which satisfactory characters are largely absent and species limits more than usually open to different interpretations by different workers”. Despite earlier attempts by Clausen (1938a) and Wieffering (1964) to revise the group, a modern monograph 9is still required. Brownsey et al. (1985) summarised understanding of the New Zealand species, but little progress has been made since then, and their conclusions are followed here. Wagner (1990) recognised three subgenera in Ophioglossum – Ophioderma , Cheiroglossa and Ophioglossum . Cheiroglossa has a single epiphytic species in the New World tropics, Indo-China, Madagascar and Reunion, and is now often recognised at the generic level (e.g. Wagner & Wagner 1993). Ophioderma , with 1–4 epiphytic species, is confined to the Old World tropics. The majority of the species, including the two New Zealand species, are terrestrial and fall into subgenus Ophioglossum . 1 Sterile blade of frond 0.5–14(20) mm wide, base attenuate to acuminate; veins often indistinct; sporophore with 3–17(20) pairs of sporangia ...................... coriaceum Sterile blade of frond (5)8–34 mm wide, base cuneate to truncate; veins usually distinct; sporophore with (13)18–48 pairs of sporangia .............................. petiolatum Distribution: Cosmopolitan but with most species in the tropics (Wagner 1990). About eight species in temperate South America (Zuloaga et al. 2008), 15 in southern Africa (Crouch et al. 2011), seven in Australia (Chinnock 1998) and five or six in the Pacific. Two species in New Zealand; one endemic. Biostatus: Indigenous (Non-endemic). Table 3 : Number of species in New Zealand within Ophioglossum L. Category Number Indigenous (Endemic) 1 Indigenous (Non-endemic) 1 Total 2 Recognition: Ophioglossum is recognised by its fronds which comprise an entire sterile blade with reticulate veins and an undivided sporophore. The sporangia are deeply sunken in the sporophore. By contrast, Botrychium has a dissected sterile blade with free veins and a branched sporophore with shortly stalked sporangia clustered on the branches. Species of Ophioglossum are unlike any other ferns in New Zealand in that the fronds unroll laterally from the centre rather than uncoiling lengthwise. Cytology: The base chromosome number in Ophioglossum is x = 30 (Wagner 1990). Notes: A single collection from “Gisborne”, without collector or date (AK 58916), has been identified by M.P. Robinson (University of Adelaide, Australia) as “probably” the Australian species O. polyphyllum A.Braun. It is unclear whether the specimen is from Gisborne, New Zealand or Gisborne, near Melbourne, Australia, but a specimen of Asplenium hookerianum with the same locality and handwriting (AK 58913) suggests that they came from New Zealand because A. hookerianum is extremely rare in Australia. No other collection of O. polyphyllum is known from New Zealand, and Ophioglossum is rare in the entire Gisborne Ecological Province with only two collections of O. coriaceum having been made from Mt Hikurangi at high altitude. In Australia O. polyphyllum is widespread in arid areas (Chinnock 1998), and its occurrence in dry parts of the east coast of New Zealand is therefore possible. However, its presence needs confirmation and cannot be accepted on the basis of this specimen alone. 1",,1-5mm-long; 7-32mm-long; 5-18mm-wide; 3-30mm-long; 3-15mm-long; 2.5-10mm-wide,,1mm-long; 0.7mm,,0.8-1.3mm,,,15-57mm-long,Ophioglossaceae,"['indigenous', 'non-endemic']"

It is found on dunes, in wet hollows, salt meadow and grassland, on grassy and mossy banks, in short turf vegetation, herbfield, on lake and tarn margins, on peat and Sphagnum in boggy areas, on tracksides, streambanks, river flats and river beds, on gravel, shingle or scoria, in open tussock, on scree and rock, on pākihi, around sinkholes and near waterfalls or in seepages on rock faces. It occurs more frequently in damper areas. The plant often dies down completely in winter, emerging again in spring from the underground rhizome. Recognition: Ophioglossum coriaceum is much more common in New Zealand than O. petiolatum . Although most plants can be distinguished by a combination of characters, there is some overlap in 11their range of variation. Ophioglossum coriaceum has a generally narrower sterile blade (rarely more than 14 mm wide) that tapers to an attenuate or acuminate base and often has indistinct veins; the length:width ratio is usually more than 3:1. The sporophore is shorter (3–21 mm long) and has fewer sporangia (very rarely more than 17 pairs). By contrast, O. petiolatum has a broader sterile blade (rarely less than 8 mm wide) that is cuneate to truncate at the base and often has distinct veins; the length:width ratio is almost always less than 3:1. The sporophore is generally longer (10–55 mm long) with more sporangia (rarely less than 17 pairs). Ophioglossum coriaceum is very variable in size and leaf shape but is more consistent with respect to the number of pairs of sporangia in the sporophore. Etiolated plants occur in bogs and wet substrates on the West Coast of the South Island and on the Chatham Islands, and have much longer dimensions than those elsewhere. The extreme sizes given in the description are from such plants, or from plants growing in very sheltered habitats, often at higher altitudes. Harris (1955) and Large & Braggins (1991) noted differences in the spores of the two species. Ophioglossum coriaceum has smaller spores with larger and more widely spaced pits on the surface, whereas O. petiolatum has larger spores with smaller, closely packed pits, giving an almost micro- papillate appearance. Whilst confirming these observations, Brownsey & Lovis (unpublished results) also found that populations of O. coriaceum with n = c. 360 had larger spores than those with n = 120, but were indistinguishable in other morphological characters. Cytology: n = 120 (Brownsey & Lovis in Dawson et al. 2000); n = c. 360 (Brownlie 1958). Lovis (in Dawson et al. 2000) reported several populations from Canterbury with 350–360 univalents, suggesting that they were probably apomictic. Counts of n = 120 have been reported from numerous populations in both main islands. Notes: The correct name for this taxon in New Zealand is unclear. It was first described as a distinct species by Cunningham (1837), but Clausen (1938a) reduced all South American, Australian and New Zealand material to a subspecies of the northern hemisphere O. lusitanicum . Subsequently Marticorena & Rodríguez (1995) and Chinnock (1998) treated southern hemisphere material as O. lusitanicum . Chromosome counts of n = 120 for some populations of the species in New Zealand (see Dawson et al. 2000) are consistent with the count of n = 125–130 for European material (Manton 1950). However, polyploid counts have also been recorded in this species complex, some of them possibly apomictic. Ninan (1956, 1958) reported n = 240 in Indian plants, Brownlie (1958) and Lovis (in Dawson et al. 2000) recorded n = c. 360 in New Zealand plants, and Verma (1957) reported n = 510 in the only Australian plant counted. Clearly this species aggregate is cytologically complex, and the relationship between plants of different ploidy unresolved. The name O. coriaceum , based on a New Zealand type, is conservatively retained here for the New Zealand taxon until the taxonomy of Ophioglossum is more fully resolved. The names O. lusitanicum L. and O. vulgatum var. lusitanicum Hook.f. have been widely used by New Zealand authors for O. coriaceum . The names O. vulgatum var. gramineum (Willd.) Hook.f. and O. gramineum Willd. have also been applied to New Zealand material (Hooker 1854–1855; Armstrong 1881a), but these are also probably misidentifications of O. coriaceum .

"Ophioglossum petiolatum Hook., Exot. Fl. 1, 56, t. 56 (1823)",,70-345mm-long; 11-115mm-long; 8-37mm-wide; 5mm-wide,"Occurs in the open, in open bush, or under kānuka or podocarp forest, usually on the margins of swamps, lakes, ponds and streams, in alluvial soils and damp hollows, amongst Dacrycarpus dacrydioides roots, in short grassland or on thermally heated soil. The plant dies down completely in winter, emerging again in spring from the underground rhizome. Recognition: Ophioglossum petiolatum is a rare fern in New Zealand. It is distinguished from O. coriaceum by its broader sterile blade (rarely less than 8 mm wide) which has a cuneate or truncate base, and often has distinct veins; the length:width ratio is almost always less than 3:1. The sporophore is generally longer (10–55 mm long) and has more sporangia (rarely less than 17 pairs). By contrast, O. coriaceum has a generally narrower sterile blade (rarely more than 14 mm wide) that tapers to an attenuate or acuminate base and often has indistinct veins. The sporophore is shorter (3–21 mm long) and has fewer sporangia (rarely more than 17 pairs). Ophioglossum petiolatum is variable in size and leaf shape. Larger plants are readily distinguishable from O. coriaceum by their broader sterile laminae with truncate bases, but small plants and stunted forms from thermal sites overlap significantly in their range of variation. In particular, plants from Scott Point, near Cape Maria van Diemen, have short fertile spikes even on bigger plants, and some are very stunted, resembling O. coriaceum . No true O. coriaceum has been recorded from this locality. Cytology: No accurate chromosome count has been obtained for Ophioglossum petiolatum , but Brownsey in Dawson et al. (2000) and de Lange et al. (2004) both recorded irregular pairing at meiosis. Notes: Many earlier authors referred this species in New Zealand to O. pedunculosum Desv. or Ophioglossum vulgatum var. pedunculosum (Desv.) Domin, but the nomenclatural confusion surrounding the use of these names has been resolved by Clausen (1938a, 1938b) and the implications for New Zealand plants explained in detail by Brownsey et al. (1985). The names O. vulgatum L., O. costatum R.Br. and O. vulgatum var. costatum (R.Br.) Hook.f. have also been used incorrectly for O. petiolatum , or erroneously recorded for New Zealand. Clausen (1938a, 1938b) referred the New Zealand plant to O. petiolatum . He distinguished it from the closely related O. reticulatum L. by its “lance-ovate blade, which is acute at the apex, by the rather long, slender fertile segment, and by the lax venation”, but conceded that the two intergraded in India, China and Mexico. Wieffering (1964) went further and reduced O. petiolatum to synonymy with O. reticulatum , although admitting that it was “highly polymorphous” with chromosome numbers ranging 14from n = 120 to c. 630. The name O. reticulatum has been used for Australian material (Chinnock 1998). However, in the absence of any conclusive evidence, Brownsey et al. (1985) followed Brownlie (1969, 1977) in recognising the species in the Pacific as O. petiolatum , a precedent which is followed here in the interests of consistency and stability.

Leptopteris hymenophylloides (A.Rich.),,220-980mm-long,"A terrestrial fern that occurs in lowland to montane areas, under kauri, podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, especially on damp banks and along streams, but also on drier valley sides and ridge tops. It frequently occurs with L. superba , but the latter is usually confined to damper sites and valley floors. Recognition: Leptopteris hymenophylloides has very thin, membranous fronds, resembling filmy ferns and can be confused with them when very young. It is distinguished from L. superba by its longer stipe, triangular lamina, longer and broader pinnae, and by its ultimate laminal segments, which are flattened in the plane of the frond. The basal pinnae (50–120 mm long) are significantly longer than those in L. superba (1–20 mm long) and this character alone will usually distinguish the two species. Cytology: n = 22 (Manton 1950; Brownlie 1958; Brownsey 1981). Hybridisation: Leptopteris hymenophylloides and L. superba frequently occur together in wet, forested areas, and they hybridise readily. Hybrids ( Leptopteris ×intermedia ) show regular bivalent formation at meiosis and have spores of normal appearance, but there is no evidence for second- generation hybrids (Brownsey 1981).

Leptopteris superba (Colenso),,250-1000mm-long,"A terrestrial fern that occurs in lowland to montane forest, growing best in cool, shaded forest in wetter sites and valley floors, sometimes in boggy ground. It requires constant high humidity, and cannot tolerate high temperature or light intensity. It is found primarily in beech, podocarp or kāmahi forest, extending locally into subalpine scrub. Recognition: Leptopteris superba has very thin, membranous fronds, resembling filmy ferns, and can be confused with them when very young. It is distinguished from L. hymenophylloides by its shorter stipe, lamina that tapers to both ends, shorter and narrower pinnae, and by its ultimate laminal segments that are bent upwards away from the lamina surface like the pile of a carpet. The basal pinnae (1–20 mm long) are significantly shorter than those in L. hymenophylloides (50–120 mm long) and this character alone will usually distinguish the two species. Cytology: n = 22 (Manton 1950; Brownlie 1958; Brownsey 1981). Hybridisation: Leptopteris superba and L. hymenophylloides frequently occur together in wet, forested areas, and they hybridise readily. Hybrids ( Leptopteris ×intermedia ) show regular bivalent formation at meiosis and have spores of normal appearance, but there is no evidence for second- generation hybrids (Brownsey 1981). 5Fig. 5 : Leptopteris superba : mature plant growing on the forest floor.Fig. 6 : Leptopteris superba : mature frond showing very short basal pinnae and stipe.

Leptopteris ×intermedia (André) Brownsey, New Zealand J. Bot. 19: 351 (1981) ≡ Todea intermedia André, L’Illustration Horticole 24: 141, t. 290 (1877) Type: New Zealand, not located (Brownsey 1981) Etymology: From the Latin intermedius (intermediate), a reference to the hybrid origin of this fern, which is intermediate between L. hymenophylloides and L. superba . Biostatus: Indigenous (Endemic). Recognition: Leptopteris hymenophylloides and L. superba frequently occur together in wet, forested areas, and they hybridise readily. Plants of Leptopteris ×intermedia are intermediate in morphology between the two parent species (Brownsey 1981, fig. 1). They often have a degree of hybrid vigour and fronds are frequently larger than those of either parent species. The laminae are generally elliptic in outline, like L. superba , but the basal pair of pinnae are longer and the primary pinnae broader than in that species. The ultimate laminal segments are sometimes bent at 90º to the plane of the frond, but not as frequently as in L. superba . Cytology: n = 22 (Brownsey 1981). Hybrids show regular bivalent formation at meiosis and have spores of normal appearance, suggesting some degree of fertility (Brownsey 1981). 6Fig. 9 : Leptopteris ×intermedia : mature frond with pinnae decreasing in length towards the base, and a few ultimate laminal segments bent upwards.Fig. 10 : Leptopteris ×intermedia : lamina showing primary and secondary pinnae, with a few ultimate laminal segments bent upwards. Osmunda L., Sp. Pl., 1063 (1753) Type taxon: Osmunda regalis L. Etymology: Derivation unclear, but an old English name either for Osmund the ferryman, who saved the lives of his wife and daughter by hiding them amongst these ferns (Field 1890), or for Osmunder, the Anglo-Saxon god of thunder, equivalent to the Norse god Thor (Gledhill 2008), or King Osmund who reigned over the South Saxons about 785 AD (Burrows 1990 – see under Osmunda regalis ). Terrestrial ferns. Rhizomes erect, often forming a short woody trunk covered with persistent stipe bases. Rhizome scales absent. Fronds dimorphic. Stipes glabrous or woolly hairy. Laminae 2-pinnate, coriaceous, opaque, with stomata, deciduous, glabrous or hairy. Sporangia borne on highly modified and reduced laminal segments. Spores trilete, radially symmetrical, tuberculate with tubercles bearing slender echinate processes. Taxonomy: A genus of about 10 species. Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences from seven plastid loci by Metzgar et al. (2008) has shown that Osmundastrum is distinct from Osmunda , and that the latter comprises three separate subgenera. A single naturalised species is present in New Zealand (Brownsey in Webb et al. 1988; Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth 2000), which is easily distinguished from the native species of Todea and Leptopteris by its markedly different fertile and sterile pinnae. Distribution: About 10 species, with one very widespread species, another in temperate North America and Eurasia, and the rest in east and south-east Asia. One species fully naturalised in New Zealand. Biostatus: Exotic; fully naturalised. Table 3 : Number of species in New Zealand within Osmunda L.

Recognition: Todea barbara is recognised by its coriaceous, bipinnate fronds, bearing sporangia that are not aggregated into sori but completely cover the undersides of the proximal pinnae.

Lecanopteris novae-zealandiae (Baker),,150-900mm-long,"Lecanopteris novae-zealandiae is usually epiphytic, or occasionally found on fallen logs, in damp montane forests of the North Island. It is found in a range of podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest. Recognition: Lecanopteris novae-zealandiae can be confused with L. pustulata , especially when young. However, it is generally a larger plant, rarely if ever produces undivided fronds, and has very distinctive spreading, orange-brown rhizome scales. Hydathodes on the adaxial lamina surface are present but inconspicuous. The thicker rhizomes (>4 mm diameter), distinctive rhizome scales, coriaceous lamina and bright green colour distinguish it from Lecanopteris scandens . 5Cytology: n = 37 (de Lange et al. 2004).

Lecanopteris pustulata (G.Forst.),35-220mm-long; 6-30mm-wide; 25-185mm-long; 4-30mm-wide,45-750mm-long,"Lecanopteris pustulata is found creeping, and often covering extensive areas, on the ground, growing over rocks or fallen logs, on cliffs and banks, or epiphytic on native and naturalised trees. It occurs in coastal to montane forest, pine forest, scrub, scoria and open areas, usually in slightly drier habitats, extending into subalpine scrub in the southern South Island. Recognition: This is the commonest and most variable of the three species of Lecanopteris in New Zealand. It can be distinguished by its thick rhizomes (>4 mm diameter) with appressed blackish- brown scales, its very variable fronds (Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth 2000, fig. 63), coriaceous and bright glossy green laminae, conspicuous veins and hydathodes on the upper lamina surface, and broad lamina lobes. Occasional aberrant forms are found, either crested at the apices or with 2-pinnatifid laminae. Only one subspecies is present in New Zealand. Lecanopteris pustulata subsp. howensis (Tindale et P.S.Green) Perrie & Brownsey is recognised as endemic to Lord Howe Island (Bostock & Spokes 1998 – as Microsorum ). It is distinguished by having rhizome scales that are abruptly acuminate and 1.5–3.3 mm wide, laminae that are usually divided to the rachis into adnate pinnae, and sori that are deeply sunken into the lamina and usually either submarginal or about one-third of the way to the costa. Cytology: n = 37 (Brownlie 1954, as Microsorium diversifolium ). 8Notes: This species has been widely known as Phymatosorus diversifolius (e.g. Brownsey & Smith- Dodsworth 1989), Microsorum diversifolium (e.g. Crookes 1963) or Phymatodes diversifolium (e.g. Allan 1961), with these combinations being based on Polypodium diversifolium Willd. collected in Tasmania by Labillardière. An earlier basionym, Polypodium pustulatum G.Forst., was for many years considered a “ species dubia ” because of the inadequate type specimen lacking a rhizome, which could not be distinguished as either diversifolium or novae-zealandiae (Pichi Sermolli 1951). However, on the basis of spore morphology, Large et al. (1992b) showed conclusively that the specimen is the same as the former, and that Forster’s name, P. pustulatum , should take priority. The species was initially treated as Microsorum pustulatum by Large et al. (1992b), then as Phymatosorus pustulatus (Large et al. 1992a), and more recently as Zealandia pustulata (Testo et al. 2019). Robert Brown’s Polypodium billardierei , and names based on his type from Port Dalrymple, are later synonyms. The name Polypodium phymatodes L. used by Richard (1832) is a misidentification.​​​​​ Fig. 11 : Lecanopteris pustulata .

Lecanopteris scandens (G.Forst.),,45-620mm-long,"Creeping on the ground, over rocks or on banks, climbing trees, or epiphytic. Common in a wide range of coastal and lowland scrub and forest, usually in damper habitats. Recognition: This species can be distinguished from the other species of Lecanopteris in New Zealand by its thin (<4 mm diameter) wiry rhizome with small, squarrose, blackish-brown scales, thinner dull green laminae, and generally smaller sori. It also has a musky scent when fresh, as reflected in its common name. Occasional aberrant forms are found – either crested at the apices or with bifid laminae. Cytology: n = 37 (Brownlie 1958, as Microsorium pustulatum ). 11Notes: This fern has been widely misidentified by earlier New Zealand authors as Polypodium pustulatum, Phymatodes pustulata or Microsorium pustulatum (see Brownsey et al. 1985) .​​​​​ Fig. 22 : Lecanopteris scandens .

Fil. 217 (1947) Type taxon: Loxogramme lanceolata (Sw.) C.Presl Etymology: From the Greek loxos (oblique), and gramme (a line), a reference to the sori, which are mostly elongate and oblique to the costa. Epiphytic or rupestral ferns. Rhizomes erect (NZ) to long-creeping (not NZ), scaly. Rhizome scales clathrate, squarrose. Fronds monomorphic (NZ) to dimorphic (not NZ), articulation evident or not, undivided, herbaceous to coriaceous, virtually glabrous. Veins reticulate; areoles with (not NZ) or without (NZ) free included veinlets; hydathodes absent. Sori mostly elongate, or rarely round, sometimes partly impressed into the lamina and bulging on upper surface, arranged in one row either side of midrib (NZ) or often confluent with age (not NZ), often confined to upper part of frond; paraphyses present as narrow scales (NZ) or absent (not NZ); exindusiate. Spores monolete, bilaterally symmetrical, granulate. Taxonomy: A genus of about 34 species (Hennipman et al. 1990). The monotypic genus Anarthropteris was created by Copeland (1947) with the New Zealand species, A. lanceolata, as the sole representative . Thus construed, Anarthropteris was one of only three fern genera (all monotypic) endemic to New Zealand (Brownsey et al. 1985; Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth 2000). Copeland considered it closely related to Loxogramme , but distinguished by its more or less round sori, distinctive receptacular scales, and spore morphology. However, all these characters are highly variable within Loxogramme. Kreier & Schneider (2006) have since shown, based on DNA 13sequences from four chloroplast genome regions, that Anarthropteris is nested within Loxogramme , and better treated in the latter genus. When treated in Loxogramme, the correct name for the New Zealand species is L. dictyopteris (Mett.) Copel . (Kreier & Schneider 2006), which is adopted here. Loxogramme scolopendrioides (Gaud.) C.V.Morton was erroneously recorded for New Zealand by earlier authors but is now excluded (Morton 1973). Distribution: Mostly tropical but a few species extending into south temperate regions; one in Central America, four in Africa, two in the Pacific, and the majority in Malesia. One species endemic to New Zealand. Biostatus: Indigenous (Non-endemic).

Loxogramme dictyopteris (Mett.),,40-360mm-long; 4-35mm-wide,"A low epiphyte on trunks and fallen logs, or on acidic and calcareous rocks and banks, in damp shaded parts of coastal and lowland broadleaved forest; sometimes in shaded hollows of open scoria. It covers large areas on trunks or rocks owing to its proliferous roots, but rarely occurs far above ground level. It often wilts conspicuously in dry weather. Recognition: This species is easily recognised by its undivided fronds, and large, exindusiate, round or slightly elongate sori. The proliferous roots, giving rise to new plants at intervals, can be confused for a creeping rhizome, but the species has an erect rhizome, which distinguishes it from Pyrrosia species and juvenile plants of Lecanopteris species. It can be further distinguished from Pyrrosia by its glabrous lamina, and from Lecanopteris by its lack of free, included veinlets in the areoles. Occasional aberrant fronds are found, either crested at the apices or with the lamina divided into short, lateral segments. Cytology: n = 37 (Brownlie 1958, as Anarthropteris dictyopteris ). Notes: This species has a complex taxonomic history, documented by Pichi Sermolli (1975). The earliest name, Polypodium attenuatum R.Br., used by Richard (1832), was a misidentification for what is now known as Dictymia brownii (Wikstr.) Copel., but was in any case illegitimate because of a previously published homonym. The species was first validly described as Dictymia lanceolata by Hooker (1855), but when transferred to Loxogramme , Copeland (1929a) had to base his new combination on a later name, Polypodium dictyopteris Mettenius (1861), because the combination based on D. lanceolata was pre-occupied in Loxogramme . However, when he transferred it again to his new genus Anarthropteris , Copeland (1947) incorrectly used the combination Anarthropteris dictyopteris , overlooking the earlier binomial, Dictymia lanceolata . Moore (in Allan 1961) established the correct combination, Anarthropteris lanceolata , but attributed the species name incorrectly to J. Smith, rather than J.D. Hooker. This error was corrected by Pichi Sermolli (1975), who established the correct name, Anarthropteris lanceolata (J.Sm. ex Hook.f.) Pic.Serm. However, when treated in Loxogramme , the correct name is L. dictyopteris (Mett.) Copel. (Kreier & Schneider 2006). 15Fig. 31 : Loxogramme dictyopteris .

Etymology: From the Greek nipho - (snow) and - idius (resembling), a reference to the densely tomentose fronds of the type species. Epiphytic or terrestrial ferns. Rhizomes short to long-creeping, terete, lacking cavities, occasionally pruinose, scaly. Rhizome scales clathrate, squarrose. Fronds monomorphic, articulated to rhizome, undivided, coriaceous, virtually glabrous. Veins reticulate; areoles with free included veinlets; hydathodes often present.

Notogrammitis angustifolia (Jacq.),,15-220mm-long; 2-7mm-wide; 0.1-0.5mm-long; 7mm-wide,"Notogrammitis angustifolia is found as an epiphyte in podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, in subalpine scrub, and rarely on cliff faces and banks. It favours high rainfall areas and has been recorded growing on Dicksonia squarrosa , Archeria sp., Brachyglottis elaeagnifolia , Carpodetus serratus , Coprosma antipoda , C. dumosa , C. foetidissima , C. grandifolia , C. pseudocuneata , Dracophyllum arboreum , D. scoparium , Griselinia littoralis , Halocarpus bidwillii , H. biformis , Libocedrus bidwillii , Metrosideros umbellata , Olearia avicenniifolia , O. chathamica , O. colensoi , O. ilicifolia , Phyllocladus alpinus , Podocarpus laetus , P. totara , Prumnopitys ferruginea , Pseudowintera colorata , Quintinia serrata , Toronia toru , Weinmannia racemosa and species of Nothofagaceae , as well as in Pleurophyllum bog and Carex ternaria swamp. Recognition: Notogrammitis angustifolia is distinguished by its usually erect rhizome, narrow and glabrous fronds (<7 mm wide), lack of distinct stipes, absence of hairs in the sori, and sori often ± parallel to the midrib. It lacks setae and hairs with setiform branches.The number of pairs of sori is very variable, but they are often absent from the apical portion of the frond. Aberrant forms with forked laminae are occasionally found. Cytology: No chromosome count has been made from New Zealand plants, but n = 37 has been recorded for Australian material (Parris 1998). Hybridisation: There is morphological evidence for occasional hybrids between N. angustifolia and N. billardierei (CHR 178291, 189609, 214621, 387076). Notes: This species was previously known in Australasia as Grammitis magellanica Desv. (e.g. Parris 1998; Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth 2000). The earliest basionym for the species is Asplenium angustifolium Jacq.; the combination in Grammitis is pre-occupied by G. angustifolia Hew. (1838), but is available in the new genus Notogrammitis (Perrie & Parris 2012). Parris & Given (1976) recognised two subspecies in New Zealand: subsp. angustifolia , confined to the subantarctic, and subsp. nothofageti , confined to the main islands. Subsp. angustifolia was distinguished by its habit of growing in colonies, its lax fronds, and its often darkened vein endings, whereas subsp. nothofageti was distinguished by its solitary habit, erect or pendulous fronds, and vein endings that were not darkened. It was also said to have larger sporangia and spores than subsp. angustifolia (Parris & Given 1976). However, with the benefit of additional specimens the distinction between the two subspecies is much less clear, and they are not recognised here. Fig. 41 : Notogrammitis angustifolia .

Notogrammitis billardierei (Willd.),,20-245mm-long; 2-11mm-wide; 1.3mm-long,"Notogrammitis billardierei is found in podocarp, broadleaved, beech and coastal forest, and in subalpine scrub. It grows as an epiphyte on forest trees as well as on roots, rotting logs, mossy rocks and banks, under rock overhangs, on root plates, and on the ground. It has been recorded growing on Blechnum discolor , Cyathea smithii , Dicksonia fibrosa , D. squarrosa , Ackama rosifolia , Beilschmiedia tarairi , Brachyglottis elaeagnifolia, Elaeocarpus dentatus , Fuchsia excorticata , Griselinia littoralis , Ixerba brexioides , Knightia excelsa , Lepidothamnus intermedius , Libocedrus plumosa , Metrosideros robusta , M. umbellata , Olearia colensoi , Podocarpus laetus , P. totara , Prumnopitys ferruginea , Pseudopanax crassifolius , Quintinia serrata , Weinmannia racemosa , W. sylvicola , and species of Nothofagaceae . Recognition: Notogrammitis billardierei is easily the most common and variable species of the genus in New Zealand. It is characterised by its erect or short-creeping rhizome, relatively large fronds, lack of distinct stipes, hairs largely confined to the base of the frond, and absence of hairs in the sori. Plants with few hairs on the frond can be confused with N. angustifolia , but generally have larger fronds (20–245 mm long, 2–11 mm wide; cf. 15–220 mm long, 2–7 mm wide), and longer, oblique sori (up to 9 mm long, cf. up to 5 mm long), together with different hair types. Plants with short-creeping rhizomes can be mistaken for N. givenii , but the latter generally has long-creeping rhizomes, distinct stipes, obovate rather than narrowly elliptic laminae, and shorter fronds (9–115 mm long). Cytology: n = 37 (Brownlie 1958 – as Grammitis billardierei ). Hybridisation: There is convincing evidence for very rare hybridisation between N. billardierei and N. heterophylla (CHR 215640, Parris 1977), and there may also be occasional hybrids between N. billardierei and N. angustifolia (CHR 178291, 189609, 214621, 387076). A single collection (WELT P027882) has the frond morphology of N. billardierei but the soral hairs of N. patagonica and is likely to be a hybrid between the two species. 23Notes: Perrie & Parris (2012) showed that, based on chloroplast DNA sequences, material of N. billardierei from Tasmania differed significantly from New Zealand plants, while Sundue et al. (2014) demonstrated that material from the Dandenong Range, Victoria, differed from both Tasmanian and New Zealand material. If further investigation confirms these results, the New Zealand and Victorian plants might need new names. Fig. 48 : Notogrammitis billardierei .

Notogrammitis ciliata (Colenso),,9-80mm-long; 100mm-long; 1.5-6mm-wide; 8mm-wide; 2.1mm-long; 9-80mm-long; 1.5-6mm-wide; 22-165mm-long; 3-12mm-wide,"Notogrammitis ciliata is usually a terrestrial species found under kauri, broadleaved and beech forest, and under mānuka and kānuka scrub. It grows on mossy rock faces and boulders, on clay track banks, stream banks and damp earth, on humus mounds, around roots and trunk bases, and rarely as a low epiphyte on Cyathea dealbata , Agathis australis , Phyllocladus trichomanoides and Nestegis lanceolata . It is sometimes found growing among terrestrial forest mosses such as Leucobryum . Recognition: Notogrammitis ciliata is characterised by its erect to short-creeping rhizomes, lack of distinct stipes, small fronds (usually 9–80 mm long, 1.5–6 mm wide), fronds that are hairy throughout, and the presence of long hairs in the sori. The species is also distinguished by its habitat, which is almost always terrestrial on rocks and clay banks in lowland and montane areas. However it is very variable with respect to the abundance, length and colour of the hairs on the lamina. It can be confused with N. patagonica and N. gunnii , which have fronds bearing very similar arrangements of hairs, but they have long-creeping rhizomes, more obviously obovate fronds, and habitats that are predominantly alpine or subalpine. Notogrammitis ciliata can also be confused with N. pseudociliata , but the latter is always epiphytic and has larger fronds (22–165 mm long, 3–12 mm wide), and lamina margins that are sometimes scalloped and undulate rather than entire and flat. Cytology: The count of n = 37 reported by Brownlie (1961– as Grammitis ciliata ) is now known to relate to Notogrammitis patagonica (see Perrie & Parris 2012, Table 1). Hybridisation: There is evidence that Notogrammitis ciliata hybridises with N. heterophylla (AK 302263). Notes: No type was specified for Grammitis australis var. villosa by Hooker (1854–1855), and its synonymy with Notogrammitis ciliata is based on historical precedent first determined by Cheeseman (1906). Perrie & Parris (2012) and Sundue et al. (2014) showed that, based on chloroplast DNA sequences, plants of N. ciliata in New Zealand are genetically polymorphic. Further work is needed to see if morphological variation is correlated with genetic variation, whether more than one species is represented in New Zealand, and whether hybrids or cryptic species are involved. Morphological variation that differs from typical N. ciliata includes plants with crenate margins and teeth to 0.5 mm long (WELT P030639), setae sometimes absent from the sori (CHR 312140, 402521 p.p.), setae absent from the lower surface of the lamina including the sori (AK 289892, Stanley s.n ., Mt William), setae on abaxial surface of midrib only (AK 291078, Kawau Island; Jane s.n. to be deposited in AK), hydathodes present at vein endings on adaxial surface (CHR 312140; CHR 402521 p.p.), and the lamina of living material dark green, fleshy ( Jane s.n . to be deposited in AK). 26Fig. 57 : Notogrammitis ciliata .

Notogrammitis crassior (Kirk),,4-42mm-long; 1-5mm-wide; 0.6mm-long,"Notogrammitis crassior is found in mountain beech forest, subalpine scrub, tussock, subalpine grassland, and in alpine fellfield and herbfield. It is a rare epiphyte on mountain beech, and usually forms mats on mossy rocks and cliff faces, in rock crevices, among scree, and under rock overhangs. It is often associated with alpine mosses such as Racomitrium. It occurs on a wide variety of substrates, including greywacke, granite, gneiss, schist, basalt, limestone, marble, ash, and andesite. It is one of the few truly alpine ferns in New Zealand and occurs at higher altitudes than most other New Zealand pteridophytes (Parris & Given 1976). Recognition: Notogrammitis crassior is characterised by its long-creeping rhizomes, indistinct stipes, very small fronds (up to 42 mm long and 5 mm wide), lack of hairs, and sori that are confined to the frond apices. Its habitat is almost exclusively alpine or subalpine, very rarely in forest, and its small, glabrous fronds will distinguish it from N. givenii , N. gunnii and N. patagonica , which also occur in this zone. It lacks setae or hairs with setiform branches. Cytology: n = 37 (Brownlie 1958 – as Grammitis pumila ). Counts of n = 37 and n = 74 have been reported from Australian populations (Parris 1998; Tindale & Roy 2002) with n = 37 reported from high alpine material and n = 74 from forest material. Notes: Kirk (1885) described his new species as Polypodium crassium. The epithet “crassium” is a neuter comparative, but is not good Latin and should have been “crassius”. Allan (1961) pointed out that the word is spelled “crassum” on the type sheet, and suggested that it had been misspelled when published, thereby implying that “crassium” was an orthographic error to be corrected to “crassum”. This had been accepted by Christensen (1905–1906), who treated it as P. crassum , and by Copeland (1951), who thought “the specific name is probably a misprint”. However, another interpretation is that Kirk intended to use a comparative adjective, “crassium”, to distinguish the name of his species from Grammitis crassa Fée, albeit in the genus Polypodium . Whether Kirk knew of G. crassa Fée is uncertain because the name was not used in any New Zealand Flora until that of Allan (1961), following the work of Copeland (1951). If the name Polypodium crassium is treated as an orthographic error for P. crassum , the combination in Grammitis is unavailable because of G. crassa Fée, but is available in Notogrammitis . Notogrammitis crassior was previously known as Grammitis poeppigiana (Mett.) Pic.Serm. (e.g. Parris 1998; Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth 2000). However, the neotype of Polypodium poeppigianum Mett. is actually a specimen of Notogrammitis angustifolia and has been reduced to synonymy under that species (Perrie & Parris 2012). No type was specified for Grammitis australis var. alpina by Jones (1861), and its synonymy with Notogrammitis crassior is based on historical precedent first determined by Perrie & Parris (2012). Perrie & Parris (2012) showed that, based on chloroplast DNA sequences, populations of N. crassior in Australia and Chile differ substantially from those in New Zealand. Some plants in Australia from 29forest are also known to be tetraploid (Parris 1998), in contrast to those in New Zealand. Further work is needed to determine whether habitat, ploidy and sequence differences are correlated. Fig. 66 : Notogrammitis crassior .

Notogrammitis givenii (Parris),,9-115mm-long; 3-12mm-wide; 1mm-long; 4-42mm-long; 1-5mm-wide,"Notogrammitis givenii is found in montane podocarp and broadleaved forest, silver and mountain beech forest, subalpine scrub, tussock grassland, and alpine herbfield. It 31grows on damp rock bluffs, on boulders, in rock crevices and sinkholes, and under overhangs on a variety of rock types including basalt, greywacke, granite, schist, gabbro, limestone and marble. Recognition: Notogrammitis givenii is characterised by its usually long-creeping rhizomes, clearly defined and hairy stipes, obovate fronds, and lack of hairs in the sori. It is similar to N. gunnii and N. patagonica , but is distinguished by its lack of hairs on the lamina surfaces and margins, and in the sori. The alpine species, N. crassior , has a much smaller frond (4–42 mm long, 1–5 mm wide; cf. 9–115 mm long, 3–12 mm wide), and is usually glabrous. N. givenii can also be mistaken for N. billardierei , but the latter generally has an erect or short-creeping rhizome, indistinct stipes, narrowly elliptic rather than obovate laminae, and longer fronds (20–245 cf. 9–115 mm long). Notes: Specimens from the subantarctic islands (Antipodes Island, Auckland Islands and Campbell Island) differ in some respects from those of more northern locations (North, South, Chatham and Stewart Islands) in having shorter and sometimes glabrous stipes, and smaller fronds. WELT P027507, from Antipodes Island, has rbcL and trnL-trnF sequences identical to those of New Zealand N. billardierei , but very different morphology, with rhizomes more widely creeping and stipe hairs, if present, not as dense.

Recognition: Notogrammitis gunnii is a poorly known species but is characterised by long-creeping rhizomes, narrowly elliptic to narrowly obovate fronds, hairs on the stipe, and short, white or pale brown hairs in the sori. It is found in the alpine or subalpine zone, and distinguished from N. givenii by the presence of short hairs in the sori. It is less easily distinguished from N. patagonica but generally has a smaller frond (up to 95 mm long, cf. up to 160 mm long) and shorter, white or pale brown stipe and soral hairs.

It is principally an epiphytic species, often associated with a variety of forest mosses, but also grows at the base of trees, on fallen logs, on humus mounds, on rock outcrops and boulders, under overhangs, amongst scoria, on track and stream banks, on wet cliff faces, and on the ground. It has been recorded growing on Cyathea dealbata , Dicksonia squarrosa , Agathis australis , Ascarina lucida , Beilschmiedia tarairi , B. tawa , Carpodetus serratus , Coprosma chathamica , C. grandifolia , C. lucida , C. rotundifolia , Coriaria arborea , Dacrydium cupressinum , Dysoxylum spectabile , Fuchsia excorticata , Griselinia littoralis , Halocarpus kirkii , Ixerba brexioides , Knightia excelsa , Melicytus ramiflorus , Metrosideros umbellata , Myrsine australis , Neomyrtus pedunculata , Olearia avicenniifolia , O. colensoi , O. furfuracea , O. rani , Phyllocladus alpinus , Pittosporum tenuifolium , Podocarpus acutifolius , P. totara , Prumnopitys ferruginea , Pseudopanax colensoi , P. crassifolius , Pseudowintera colorata , Quintinia serrata , Schefflera digitata , Streblus heterophyllus , Weinmannia racemosa , W. sylvicola , and species of Nothofagaceae . Recognition: Notogrammitis heterophylla is usually readily distinguished by its 1–2-pinnatifid fronds. Occasionally young plants have undivided fronds, but these are recognisable by their crenulate margins. All other species of Notogrammitis in New Zealand have entire fronds. Cytology: n = 37 (Brownlie 1958 – as Ctenopteris heterophylla ).

Notogrammitis patagonica (C.Chr.),,6-160mm-long; 2-10mm-wide; 3mm-long; 160mm-long,"Notogrammitis patagonica is found in podocarp and beech forest, subalpine scrub, tussock grassland, and alpine herbfield. It grows on wet cliff and rock faces, in rock crevices, under overhangs, on damp banks and stream banks, and near the base of waterfalls. It favours limestone and marble substrates, but is also found on andesite, basalt, granite, rhyolite, schist, greywacke, mudstone, and sandstone. Recognition: Notogrammitis patagonica is characterised by its long-creeping rhizomes, distinct stipes, narrowly obovate fronds, and the presence of hairs throughout the frond and in the sori. It is distinguished from N. crassior by its hairy rather than glabrous fronds, and from N. givenii by the presence of hairs on the lamina surfaces and in the sori. It is very similar to N. gunnii but generally has a larger frond (up to 160 mm long, cf. up to 95 mm long) and longer, dark red-brown stipe and soral hairs.

Recognition: Notogrammitis pseudociliata is characterised by its erect to short-creeping rhizome, lack of distinct stipes, presence of hairs all over the frond and in the sori, presence of hydathodes and its lamina margin, which is often scalloped and undulate. It is almost exclusively epiphytic on podocarp or broadleaved forest trees. The erect rhizome, and presence of hairs on the frond and in the sori distinguish it from all other species except N. ciliata . However, N. pseudociliata is always epiphytic, and has larger fronds (22–165 mm long, 3–12 mm wide; cf. 9–100 mm long,1.5–6 mm wide), and lamina margins that are often scalloped and undulate rather than entire and flat.

Notogrammitis rawlingsii (Parris),,31-165mm-long; 3-6mm-wide; 1.3mm-long,"Notogrammitis rawlingsii is confined to kauri or occasionally podocarp or hard beech forest. It usually grows on roots amongst forest mosses, on rotting logs, or sometimes on the ground. It reaches 600 m on Mt Pirongia. Recognition: Notogrammitis rawlingsii is a very distinctive species characterised by its short-creeping rhizome, lack of distinct stipes, linear fronds, and presence of stout, dark red- brown hairs in and around the soral region. It is largely confined to lowland kauri forest in the northern North Island. It 43is most similar to N. billardierei , but distinguished by the characteristic red-brown hairs in the soral region and upright habit. Fig. 116 : Notogrammitis rawlingsii .

Notogrammitis rigida (Hombr.),,75-220mm-long; 9-20mm-wide; 1.2mm; 220mm-long; 20mm-wide,"Notogrammitis rigida is found in beech, Olearia colensoi and Metrosideros umbellata forest, or under mānuka. It grows amongst mosses on wet coastal rocks, cliffs and slips, often very close to the sea. It is also epiphytic on Metrosideros umbellata or, more rarely, found in the spray zone of waterfalls . Recognition: Notogrammitis rigida is characterised by its erect to short-creeping rhizome, lack of distinct stipes, and more or less glabrous fronds, up to 220 mm long and 20 mm wide with occasional marginal projections. It is easily the largest undivided species of the genus in New Zealand and is confined to high rainfall, coastal areas in the far south of the country. It lacks setae and hairs with setiform branches. Fig. 121 : Notogrammitis rigida . Mature plant growing epiphytically, with large fronds arising from an erect rhizome. 45Phlebodium (R.Br.) J.Sm., J.

Pyrrosia elaeagnifolia (Bory),30-260mm-long; 4-20mm-wide,,"Pyrrosia elaeagnifolia is a very tough and adaptable fern, which can survive dry conditions due to its fleshy frond, dense covering of hairs and reduced lamina area. It occurs on rocks, logs, scoria and banks, and as an epiphyte on branches and trunks of native, naturalised and cultivated trees. It is found from exposed coastal situations to sheltered forest, in a wide range of scrub, beech, podocarp and broadleaved forest types. Recognition: Pyrrosia elaeagnifolia is the only species of the genus present on the main islands of New Zealand, and is easily distinguished by its long-creeping rhizome; thick, fleshy, undivided fronds; dense covering of stellate hairs; and exindusiate sori arranged in several rows either side of the midrib. Pyrrosia elaeagnifolia and P. serpens have both been recorded from the Kermadec Islands and characters for distinguishing the two are listed under the latter species. Very occasional aberrant fronds are found with lobed or bifid fronds, and sometimes the rhizome apices are fastigiately divided into multiple growing tips. The latter has been attributed to a gall- forming mite, Aceria sp. (Hovenkamp 1986, p. 178). Cytology: n = 37 (Brownlie 1961, as Pyrrosia serpens ). Notes: New Zealand plants were previously referred to P. serpens (G.Forst.) Ching, but that species has ciliate rhizome scales, whereas those in P. elaeagnifolia are more or less entire (Hovenkamp 1986; Brownsey et al. 2021). The confusion arose because Forster identified New Zealand as the type locality for P. serpens ​​​​​​, but his specimen is not conspecific with the species on the main islands of New Zealand. It was probably collected on one of the Pacific islands, and the specimen mislabelled 54(Hovenkamp 1986). P. serpens occurs across the Pacific from the Kermadec Islands and Fiji to Pitcairn Island. Pyrrosia elaeagnifolia has been widely misidentified in earlier New Zealand literature under the names Polypodium stellatum Vahl, Polypodium serpens G.Forst., Niphobolus bicolor Kaulf., and Polypodium rupestre R.Br., and combinations based on them. Cameron (2017) argued that, based on the original spelling of Elaeagnus latifolia L., the name “eleagnifolia” is an orthographic error that should be corrected to “elaeagnifolia”. That spelling is adopted here. Fig. 142 : Pyrrosia elaeagnifolia .

Pyrrosia serpens (G.Forst.),115-175mm-long; 7-10mm-wide,,"On the basal trunk of Metrosideros kermadecensis in summit forest. Recognition: Pyrrosia serpens is very similar to P. elaeagnifolia , and both species have been recorded from the Kermadec Islands. Fronds of P. serpens are generally narrower (9–15 mm wide) and more oblong in shape than those of P. elaeagnifolia , which are broader (11–31 mm wide) and more ovate or elliptic in outline. The rhizome scales of P. serpens are appressed, ovate in outline, 2–2.8 mm long, slightly ciliate, and have a conspicuous dark centre, whereas those of P. elaeagnifolia are squarrose, narrowly ovate in outline, 2–7 mm long, entire, and concolorous. However, the most obvious distinguishing character is the arrangement of the sori, which, in P. serpens , are arranged in one row either side of the midrib, often partly sunken into the lamina and protuberant on the adaxial surface, whereas in P. elaeagnifolia they are in two to five rows, superficial on the abaxial surface and not protuberant on the adaxial side. Notes: Polypodium serpens was first described by Forster (1786) and said by him to have come from New Zealand. However the lectotype (BM 001048427) is not conspecific with the species from mainland New Zealand, and almost certainly came from one of the Pacific Islands (Hovenkamp 1986). Carruthers (in Seemann 1865–1873) suggested that the locality should be the Society Islands rather than New Zealand, and a French Polynesian origin for the lectotype appears probable given the distribution of the species and Forster’s itinerary; he apparently did not collect during his visit to the Cook Islands (Sykes 2016). Brownsey et al. (2021) showed that the circumscription of Pyrrosia serpens requires further investigation. Fig. 151 : Pyrrosia serpens .

Psilotum nudum (L.),,1-3mm-long,"On Raoul Island, Psilotum nudum is common under dry forest in the crater area, usually on the forest floor, but also on rotten wood or epiphytic on Metrosideros . In Northland and on the Hauraki Gulf and Coromandel islands it occurs under pōhutukawa forest on rocky or sandy soil, on open coastal cliffs and banks, in rock crevices and amongst scoria. Very occasionally it occurs as an epiphyte on pōhutukawa or kōwhai. In Auckland City it is found on walls, in rocky areas, amongst scoria and in planted areas, where it has been accidentally introduced. Around Kāwhia Harbour it grows on limestone outcrops. However, it is most abundant on thermally heated ground in the 3Rotorua/Taupō area on cliffs, rocky ground, in crevices, around steam vents and under light kānuka and mānuka scrub. Recognition: This species is easily recognised by its twiggy, upright stems, scale-like leaves, and trilobed synangia borne adaxially on bifid sporophylls. Cytology: n = 104 (Brownsey & Lovis 1987). Notes: The gametophytes of Psilotum nudum are unusual amongst ferns in being subterranean, non- green, mycorrhizal, cylindrical and frequently branched (Holloway 1939; Bierhorst 1954). They are similar to those of Tmesipteris in this regard. Fig. 2 : Psilotum nudum : dichotomously branched aerial stem bearing trilobed synangia.Fig. 3 : Psilotum nudum : dichotomously branched aerial stem bearing trilobed synangia on adaxial surface of tiny bifid scales. Tmesipteris Bernh., J. Bot. (Schrader) 1800(2): 131 (1801) Type taxon: Tmesipteris tannensis (Spreng.) Bernh. Etymology: From the Greek tmesis (a cutting, or incision), and pteris (a fern), a reference to the sporophyll being forked, as if cut into two. Vernacular name: fork fern Epiphytic or occasionally terrestrial ferns. Rhizomes dichotomously branched, subterranean, bearing brown rhizoidal hairs. Aerial stems pendulous, unbranched or dichotomously branched, flattened, glabrous, either growing indeterminately or terminated by a large leaf. Sterile leaves scale-like proximally, expanded and flattened distally, spirally arranged or distichous, 1-veined, bases unequally cuneate. Synangia bilobed, equal or unequal, arranged on the adaxial margin of bifid sporophylls; lobes conic or round- ended. Spores monolete, ellipsoidal, rugulate to smooth. Taxonomy: A genus of about 15 species. Allan (1961) and authors of earlier New Zealand Flora treatments all recognised only a single species of Tmesipteris . Nineteenth century authors all misidentified this as T. forsteri Endl., an illegitimate name for the species now known as T. norfolkensis - a plant endemic to Norfolk Island. Later authors referred the New Zealand species to T. tannensis . However, the genus was critically revised by Chinnock (1975) who identified four species, including T. sigmatifolia which was described for the first time. A fifth species, T. horomaka , was described more recently by Perrie et al. (2010) and is so far known only from Banks Peninsula. Unlike the other New Zealand species, which are all tetraploid (Brownsey & Lovis 1987), T. horomaka is octoploid and possibly an allopolyploid derivative of T. tannensis and T. elongata . In addition, two further species may be present in New Zealand. Plants resembling T. obliqua from south-east Australia occur in the far south of the South Island, and others similar to T. norfolkensis are known from Northland and Great Barrier Island. Further work is needed to determine the true identity of these plants. A clearer understanding of the diversity within Tmesipteris has only emerged since the 1970s, with species descriptions now available for the Philippines (Gruèzo 2012), Australia (Chinnock 1998), the Solomon Islands (Braithwaite 1973), Vanuatu (Braithwaite 1986), New Caledonia (Brownlie 1969), Fiji (Brownlie 1977) and French Polynesia (Murdock & Smith 2003). 41 Sterile leaves distichously arranged ...................................................................................... 2 Sterile leaves spirally arranged .............................................................................................. 3 2 Sterile leaves ovate to elliptic, shiny green; sporophylls usually in lower half of stem; stems undivided ........................................................................................ lanceolata Sterile leaves narrowly ovate to narrowly oblong, dull green; sporophylls usually in middle or upper part of stem; stems undivided or branched one to several times ............................................................................................................ elongata 3 Synangia with pointed ends .................................................................................................. 4 Synangia with rounded ends .................................................................................................. 5 4 Synangial lobes usually separated from subtending sporophyll, pointing upwards .................................................................................................................. tannensis Syngangial lobes appressed to subtending sporophyll, pointing laterally or downwards .............................................................................................................. horomaka 5 Stems undivided; sterile leaves often slightly sigma-shaped; mucro 1.5–3.5 mm long; synangial lobes often unequal in size .................................................... sigmatifolia Stems undivided or branched one to several times; sterile leaves straight or falcate; mucro 1–2.5 mm; synangial lobes equal in size ........................................................ 6 6 Sterile leaves usually emarginate to truncate, up to 25 mm long ............................ horomaka Sterile leaves usually cuspidate to acuminate, up to 45 mm long ............................ elongata Distribution: One species in the Philippines, at least one in Papua New Guinea, seven in Australia (including Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands), three in the Solomon Islands, four in New Caledonia, three in Vanuatu and one each in Fiji, Samoa, Society Islands and the Marquesas.

"Tmesipteris elongata P.A.Dang., Botaniste Séries 2: 213, pl. 12, fig. 6 (1891)",,45mm-long; 2-9mm-wide,"Tmesipteris elongata is found commonly as an epiphyte on tree fern trunks, recorded most frequently from Cyathea dealbata and Dicksonia squarrosa , but also occasionally from Cyathea medullaris in northern New Zealand, and Cyathea smithii at higher elevations and in the South Island. It has been recorded once from Dicksonia fibrosa on the Chatham Islands (AK 230462). It is also occasionally found growing on trunks of Beilschmiedia tawa , Dysoxylum spectabile , Hedycarya arborea , Melicytus ramiflorus , Metrosideros robusta , Nestegis spp., Fuscospora solandri , and Rhopalostylis sapida , on old rotten logs, and rarely at the base of tree trunks, on banks, or in humus. It has also been recorded once from an introduced Salix species (WAIK 4672). It occurs most frequently in a wide range of broadleaved forest but also under kauri, podocarp and beech forest and in swamp forest, or rarely under Pinus radiata . In northern New Zealand the species can be found hanging from large clumps of Collospermum , and such plants are often much larger than those found on tree fern trunks. They were distinguished as T. elongata subsp. robusta by Chinnock (1975). Plants have been collected from the bases of Carex secta at Lake Koraha, Matauratahi Valley (WAIK 8847), and rather stunted plants from C. secta stems in a dense Phormium tenax swamp on the south Taranaki coast (WELT P020839). Recognition: This is one of the two widespread species of Tmesipteris in New Zealand, recognised by its somewhat flexible leaves with acuminate or cuspidate apices, and by its round-ended synangia. Its leaves are also generally longer than in other species. It is the only species with a stem that sometimes branches more than once. Some forms are very robust, branching several times, and are much bigger than any other species in New Zealand (see below). Cytology: n = 104 (Brownsey & Lovis 1987). Notes: The holotype of Dangeard’s Tmesipteris elongata has probably been destroyed (Chinnock 1975), and Dangeard’s illustration was therefore selected as lectotype (Chinnock 1998). The original localities are cited as “Terre de Van Diemen [Tasmania]; New South Wales”. Tmesipteris elongata subsp. robusta was distinguished from subsp. elongata by Chinnock (1975) primarily on the basis of its more consistently branching stem, but also by its slightly longer and broader leaves. However, it appears to overlap in all these characters with specimens of subsp. elongata , and is therefore reduced to synonymy. It is best regarded as an ecological form that grows particularly well in large clumps of Collospermum . 6Fig. 5 : Tmesipteris elongata : aerial stem growing from a tree fern trunk, bearing narrowly- ovate sterile leaves tapering to a short mucro, and sporophylls in the distal half.

"Tmesipteris horomaka Perrie, Brownsey & Lovis, New Zealand J.

A single collection has also been recorded from Phormium peat on a humid, shaded, cliff face (CHR 355608). Recognition: This species is morphologically intermediate between T. elongata and T. tannensis . It differs from T. elongata in having mostly emarginate to truncate leaves, compared to acuminate or cuspidate leaves in that species. It differs from T. tannensis in having round-ended or only slightly pointed synangia with the apices projecting laterally or downwards, compared to usually strongly pointed synangia with the apices pointing upwards in T. tannensis . 8Cytology: n = c. 208 (Perrie et al. 2010). Notes: Plants resembling Tmesipteris horomaka have been collected from Westland (CHR 325664) and Stewart Island (WELT P011165).

On Raoul Island it grows on Cyathea milnei . It occurs in kauri, podocarp, pōhutukawa and broadleaved forest, and tall kānuka scrub. Recognition: This species is easily recognised by its shorter stems, distichously arranged leaves, and synangia which are usually confined to the lower part of the stem. The leaves are also shiny green, and ovate or elliptic in shape, unlike the other species which generally have duller leaves that are longer and narrower in outline.

It has been recorded once growing in litter at the base of a kauri (CHR 302370). It occurs in kauri, podocarp, broadleaved and old kānuka forests in northern New Zealand.

Tmesipteris tannensis (Spreng.),,7-28mm-long; 2-8mm-wide,"Tmesipteris tannensis usually grows epiphytically on tree fern trunks, but, unlike other species of the genus, it is also occasionally found terrestrially on banks, rocks, humus hummocks, mossy ground and peat mounds, or amongst matted roots and kauri litter. It is most commonly found on Cyathea dealbata , but also on C. medullaris , C. smithii , Dicksonia squarrosa , D. fibrosa and D. lanata . It has also been found on Dacrydium cupressinum , Griselinia littoralis , Ixerba brexioides , Podocarpus totara , Weinmannia racemosa , beech and Metrosideros trunks. It is sometimes found hanging from clumps of Collospermum and more frequently on rotting logs or dead stumps. It occurs in kauri, podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest. On the subantarctic islands it has been recorded growing on the caudices of Chionochloa antarctica (CHR 323153) and under leatherwood scrub. Recognition: This is the most widespread species in New Zealand, recognised by its brittle, spirally arranged leaves, usually with truncate or emarginate apices and long mucro tips. The synangia are biconic, with the apices pointing upwards. It is also the species most commonly found growing terrestrially. Some plants in Westland and the far south of the South Island tend to have broader, ovate to elliptic leaves, compared to the narrower, more elongate leaves elsewhere. They resemble T. obliqua from south-east Australia, but further work is required to confirm their identity. Cytology: n = 104 (Brownsey & Lovis 1987). Notes: Chinnock (1976) indicated that the holotype of Sprengel’s Lycopodium tannense had not been located, and was probably destroyed during World War II. Although Sprengel stated that it was collected on Tanna Island by the Forsters during Cook’s second voyage, Chinnock provided cogent reasons why this could not have been the case. Instead, he suggested that it was actually collected at Dusky Sound in New Zealand, and that the plant later illustrated by Bernhardi (1801) when creating his new genus, Tmesipteris , represented the species now known as T. tannensis . Bernhardi’s illustration was almost certainly based on a specimen from Sprengel’s herbarium. It was considered to depict the type specimen of Lycopodium tannense and was selected by Chinnock as the neotype. However, Fosberg (1993) challenged Chinnock’s choice, suggesting that a specimen in S, from the Swartz herbarium, might be from the Sprengel herbarium and that it should be used to lectotypify Lycopodium tannense . Unfortunately the original label has been lost, there is no indication that the specimen was collected by the Forsters, the identity of the specimen is uncertain, and there is no certainty that Sprengel saw it. Overturning Chinnock’s neotypification on the basis of this specimen therefore seems hard to justify. Plants from Banks Peninsula (CHR 142562 and 397940) are very unusual in having leaves with acuminate apices, and require further investigation (Perrie et al. 2010). 14Fig. 27 : Tmesipteris tannensis : aerial stem showing indeterminate growth with the apex terminated by a small leaf or sporophyll.Fig. 28 : Tmesipteris tannensis : aerial stem bearing narrowly-oblong leaves abruptly truncated to long mucros, and bifid sporophylls with elongated conic synangia, with the apices pointing upwards.

Nat., ed. 10, 2, 1329 (1759)",,125-500mm-long,"Adiantum aethiopicum grows on the ground in open podocarp and broadleaved forest, under mānuka and kānuka, in coastal and gumland scrub, and under pines. It also grows amongst grass or under bracken. It favours coastal cliffs, roadside banks, creek banks, clay slopes, rocky ground, and sometimes swamp margins. Recognition: Adiantum aethiopicum is recognised by its 3–4-pinnate fronds, flabellate ultimate segments with the stalks attached centrally, glabrous rachises and laminae, reniform and glabrous “indusia”, and green abaxial lamina surface. The species is easily confused with the naturalised A. raddianum , but distinguished by its ultimate lamina segments, which are broader than long, and either entire or shallowly incised, especially at the point of attachment of the “indusia”. The ultimate segments in A. raddianum are generally longer than broad, and at least some are more deeply incised than the indusial notches, forming two or more distinct lobes. There is a true creeping rhizome in A. raddianum , whereas A. aethiopicum has a more or less erect rhizome with long-creeping stolons. Cytology: n = 60 (Brownlie 1958). 5Notes: In contrast to the count of n = 60 in New Zealand populations, 2n = 112 has been reported by Tindale & Roy (2002) in Australian plants of Adiantum aethiopicum , and n = 57 in the related A. atroviride Bostock . All New Zealand Flora writers since Hooker (1854–1855) have included Adiantum assimile Sw. in the synonymy of A. aethiopicum . Swartz (1801) described the species from an unspecified locality in Australia. Two related species, A. aethiopicum and A. atroviride , are now known to occur in Australia (Bostock 1998), their distributions overlapping in southern Queensland and New South Wales. Bostock (1998) described A. atroviride , but continued to include A. assimile in the synonymy of A. aethiopicum , even though he indicated that he had not seen the type. Without locating the type it is impossible to be certain of its affinities. Unfortunately Swartz’s herbarium in S is currently inaccessible, and the identity of A. assimile must wait until the type can be found and re-examined. Fig. 2 : Adiantum aethiopicum .

"Adiantum cunninghamii Hook., Sp. Fil. 2, 52, t. 86a (1851)",,60-900mm-long,"Adiantum cunninghamii grows on the ground under kauri, podocarp, beech and broadleaved forest, under mānuka and kānuka, in coastal and regenerating scrub, and under pines. It is found on wet rock faces and bluffs, in small caves, under waterfalls, on river banks, in gullies, among rocks or in crevices, on roadside banks, at bush margins, in clearings, along tracksides, on grassy slopes, and on coastal cliffs. It grows on greywacke, limestone, sandstone, mudstone, clay, scoria, and pumice. Recognition: Adiantum cunninghamii is a rather variable species with laminae ranging in size from 40 mm to 370 mm long. It is most commonly 3-pinnate at the base, but small fronds may be only 2- pinnate, and very rarely 4-pinnate fronds are found. It is distinguished from other species of Adiantum by its oblong ultimate lamina segments with the stalk attached in one corner, glabrous rachises, reniform and glabrous “indusia”, and often by the glaucous colour of the abaxial lamina surface. The abaxial lamina surfaces are also usually glabrous, but rarely (in <1% of collections) they bear stiff hairs. Such plants can be confused with hairy forms of A. diaphanum . Small, 2-pinnate fronds, lacking hairs on the abaxial lamina surfaces, can also be confused with glabrous forms of A. diaphanum , but A. cunninghamii always lacks the small tubers on the rootlets that are present in A. diaphanum . Large, 3–4-pinnate specimens can be distinguished from A. formosum by their glabrous costae on the primary pinnae, and by the often glaucous abaxial lamina surface. Cytology: n = 58 (Brownlie 1961, as A. affine ). Hybridisation: It is possible that Adiantum cunninghamii hybridises occasionally with A. fulvum . One collection (AK 353971) has hairs on the abaxial pinna surfaces and vestigial hairs on the rachises, but the sori are over-mature and the nature of the spores unknown (Brownsey et al. 2019). Notes: Adiantum cunninghamii was initially misidentified by early Flora writers as A. formosum R.Br. (e.g. Richard 1832), and then as A. affine Willd. (e.g. Cheeseman 1906). The type of the latter name is actually A. capillus-veneris , supposedly from New Zealand, but almost certainly with an incorrect provenance (see under Notes for A. capillus-veneris ). Along with A. fulvum , it is closely related to A. silvaticum from Queensland and New South Wales. The latter differs from A. cunninghamii by the absence of false veins between the true veins on the adaxial lamina surface (Bostock 1998). No type material of Adiantum affine var. chathamicum has been located at AK, CHR, K or WELT, and its identity remains unresolved (Brownsey & Perrrie 2020). However, Field (1890) noted that A. affine was called A. cunninghamii by Hooker, and A. affine var. chathamicum is included here as a likely synonym of A. cunninghamii . A small number of collections occur with hairs on the abaxial lamina surfaces (Brownsey et al. 2019). These are treated here alongside the more usual glabrous forms as dimorphic variation within A. cunninghamii . 10Fig. 14 : Adiantum cunninghamii .

"Adiantum diaphanum Blume, Enum. Pl. Javae 2, 215 (1828)",,50-390mm-long,"Adiantum diaphanum grows on the ground under podocarp and broadleaved forest, and under kānuka. It occurs on streambanks, river terraces, clay banks, under overhangs, wet rocks, track sides, and swamp margins in shaded sites. Recognition: Adiantum diaphanum is the smallest of the maidenhair ferns in New Zealand. The fronds are either 1-pinnate throughout, or have one, or rarely two, pairs of proximal pinnae that are divided into secondary pinnae. It is distinguished from other species of Adiantum by the presence of tubers on the roots, its oblong ultimate lamina segments with the stalk attached in one corner, its glabrous rachises, and by the green abaxial lamina surface. The species is dimorphic, the abaxial lamina surfaces and “indusia” being either hairy or glabrous. Sometimes the lamina surfaces and “indusia” are either both hairy or both glabrous, but forms are also found with hairy “indusia” and glabrous or very sparsely hairy laminae. When present, the hairy “indusia” distinguish it from all other species except A. hispidulum . That species is distinguished by its helicoid branching, more divided laminae, and hairs that are often more than one cell long. In A. diaphanum the hairs are single-celled, very dark, and with no clearly visible lumen. Plants of A. diaphanum with glabrous laminae and “indusia” can be confused with small plants of A. cunninghamii , but that species always lacks the small tubers on the rootlets that are present in A. diaphanum. Cytology: n = 116 (Brownlie 1961). Notes: Adiantum diaphanum was misidentified by some early Flora writers as A. affine Willd. (e.g., Hooker 1864), a species now known to be A. capillus-veneris . Brownsey et al. (2019) found that, among collections held at WELT, 57% had hairs on the abaxial lamina surfaces and 43% were glabrous or nearly so. Glabrous and hairy plants were sometimes found in the same population. In his original description of A. diaphanum , Blume (1828) noted that the pinnae were glabrous. Price (1990) further noted that “all plants from Java, the source of Blume’s type of A. diaphanum , have glabrous indusia”, whereas plants from the Philippines had setulose indusia 13and hairy pinnae. He suggested that the hairy plants corresponded to A. setulosum , described by Smith (1846) from Norfolk Island. However, Bostock (1992) rejected this conclusion. He noted that all 16 separate plants on three type sheets of A. diaphanum at L had at least some hairs on the laminae and “indusia”. He noted that there was “no justification whatsoever for using the name A. diaphanum Blume solely for plants with glabrous soral flaps”. He included Adiantum setulosum J.Sm. in the synonymy of A. diaphanum , a decision also followed here. The hairy and glabrous plants are treated as dimorphic character states within A. diaphanum . Cheeseman (1906) interpreted the typical state of A. diaphanum as having hairy pinnae, and recognised var. polymorphum , based on Colenso’s A. polymorphum , for the glabrous state. In any case, A. polymorphum Colenso is illegitimate, being a later homonym of A. polymorphum Poir. (1810). Further investigation is required to determine whether there is any genetic variation that supports taxonomic recognition of different forms of A. diaphanum throughout its extensive geographical range. Bostock (1992, 1998) noted that plants of A. diaphanum in Australia are not only tuberous but also proliferous, a feature recorded by Birkenhead (1886), enabling them to form small colonies. Although tubers are common in New Zealand plants, proliferation is unknown in herbarium specimens of wild plants and has only been observed in cultivated plants ( http://www.nzplants.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/ferns/native-ferns/pteridaceae-maidenhair- annual-rock-brake-ferns/adiantum-diaphanum.html ).

"Adiantum formosum R.Br., Prodr. Fl. Nov. Holland. 155 (1810)",,470-970mm-long,"In the vicinity of the Manawatū Gorge, Adiantum formosum grows on river terraces and streambanks under podocarp/broadleaved forest and scrub. It also occurs under pines and willows. Recognition: Adiantum formosum is the largest and most divided of the indigenous species in New Zealand. It is usually 4-pinnate at the base but small fronds may occasionally be 3-pinnate and large fronds rarely 5-pinnate. It has oblong ultimate segments with the stalk attached in one corner, rough but glabrous stipes and rachises, hairy costae on the pinnae, lunulate and glabrous “indusia”, and a green abaxial lamina surface. Plants from Northland (now believed extinct) have pale hairs on the abaxial lamina surfaces, but those from the Manawatū are glabrous. Cytology: n = 58 (Brownlie 1961). Notes: Adiantum formosum in Australia is dimorphic with respect to hairs on the abaxial lamina surfaces – some populations are glabrous, others bear pale, flattened hairs. The fact that, in New Zealand, plants from Northland are hairy but those from elsewhere are glabrous suggests these populations have resulted from at least two different dispersal events. The two forms have not been given any taxonomic recognition in Australia (Bostock 1998) and are treated here as dimorphic character states within A. formosum (Brownsey et al. 2019).

"Adiantum fulvum Raoul, Choix Pl. Nouv.-Zél. 9 (1846)",,170-850mm-long; 90-360mm-long; 60-275mm-wide,"Adiantum fulvum grows on the ground under kauri, podocarp, broadleaved and coastal forest, and under mānuka, kānuka and coastal scrub, usually on drier ground. It is found on streambanks, river terraces and clay banks, in gullies, among rocks, on rubbly slopes, on tracksides, road banks and rock faces, on steep hillsides, and on coastal cliffs. It occurs on greywacke, limestone and mudstone rock. Recognition: Adiantum fulvum is usually 3-pinnate at the base, but rarely large fronds may be 4- pinnate and small fronds only 2-pinnate. The species has oblong, ultimate segments that curve acroscopically at their apices; their abaxial surfaces are green, and the stalks are attached in the corners. The species is dimorphic, the abaxial lamina surfaces being either hairy or glabrous. The stipes, rachises and pinna costae bear antrorse red-brown hairs, and the “indusia” are reniform and glabrous. Large, 4-pinnate fronds can resemble small plants of A. formosum , but the stipes and rachises are hairy, whereas in A. formosum they are rough and glabrous; the “indusia” of A. formosum 18are lunulate in shape rather than truly reniform as in A. fulvum ; and the ultimate lamina segments of A. formosum are generally shorter than in A. fulvum (9–16 mm long, cf. 8–26 mm long). Cytology: n = 58 (Brownlie 1965, as A. fulvum ); 2n = 116 (Murray & de Lange 2013, as A. viridescens ). Hybridisation: It is possible that Adiantum fulvum hybridises occasionally with A. cunninghamii . One collection (AK 353971) has hairs on the abaxial pinna surfaces and vestigial hairs on the rachises, but the sori are over-mature and the nature of the spores unknown (Brownsey et al. 2019). Notes: Adiantum fulvum was described by Raoul (1846) from a collection he made on Banks Peninsula in 1843. There is also a collection made by J.F. Armstrong in 1864, and another by Thomas Kirk from Akaroa, probably in 1876. However, it has not been collected on Banks Peninsula since that date. The hairy and glabrous forms of A. fulvum were previously recognised as A. fulvum and A. viridescens (Parris & Croxall 1974). However, Brownsey et al. (2019) found that the two forms could not be distinguished by any character other than the presence or absence of hairs on the abaxial lamina surface, and proposed that they be regarded as dimorphic character states within A. fulvum , consistent with the treatment of other dimorphic Adiantum species in New Zealand. Adiantum fulvum is recorded here for the first time from the Kermadec Islands (AK 326202). Fig. 41 : Adiantum fulvum . Adaxial surface of mature 3-pinnate frond.Fig. 42 : Adiantum fulvum .

"Adiantum hispidulum Sw., J. Bot. (Schrader)",,100-730mm-long; 0.1-1.0mm-long,"Adiantum hispidulum grows on the ground under podocarp, broadleaved, beech and coastal forest, under mānuka and kānuka, in coastal scrub, and under pines. It is found on streambanks, amongst rocks and in crevices, on cuttings, on rock overhangs and rocky banks, in clearings and on bush margins, on dry hillsides and grassy slopes, on sandy banks, and on coastal cliffs. Recognition: Adiantum hispidulum can usually be distinguished from all other maidenhair ferns in New Zealand by its characteristic helicoid branching. A few plants are regularly 2–3-pinnate, and these may be confused with divided forms of A. diaphanum , but they can be distinguished by their more divided laminae and lack of tubers on the rootlets. Young fronds are also often tinged red when young. Adiantum hispidulum is dimorphic with respect to the nature of the hairs on the abaxial surface of the laminae. Most plants have short, stiff hairs 0.1–0.8 mm long, but a few have longer, lax hairs 0.3–1.0 mm long. Parris (1980) recognised the former as A. hispidulum and the latter as A. pubescens Schkuhr. However, in a detailed investigation of the two taxa, Large & Braggins (1993) found that the two taxa could only be distinguished on the basis of their hair characters, and even then there was a high degree of variability. They treated A. pubescens as a variety of A. hispidulum , and the dimorphic nature of the species can be recognised at this rank if required. Var. pubescens has a slightly different distribution to that of var. hispidulum. It is the only form that has been collected on the Kermadec Islands. Otherwise it is confined to Northland, with isolated populations at Pouto, Kaipara Harbour and Piha (Parris 1980). Its distribution in this area overlaps entirely with var. hispidulum , but it does not extend to the rest of the North Island or the South Island. Cytology: n = c. 174 (Brownlie 1957), 2n = c. 160–173, possibly apomictic (Large 1984). Notes: Further investigation is required to ascertain whether the differences in hair type on the abaxial lamina surfaces of A. hispidulum correlate with genetic differences in different parts of its extensive geographical range. 21Fig. 50 : Adiantum hispidulum .

Anogramma leptophylla (L.),15-115mm-long,,"Anogramma leptophylla is an annual fern, sprouting in May in northern districts, later in the south, reaching maturity in August and September. It dies away as the ground dries out and regenerates each year from spores or perennial tubers on the prothalli. It is found on steep banks and rock faces, in rock crevices, on scoria bluffs, on grassy streambanks and grassy hillsides, and on shoreline rocks, often at scrub margins or under light scrub or kānuka. It grows on volcanic and calcareous substrates. It is often associated with the liverwort Targionia hypophylla and frequently grows amongst grasses and weedy species. Recognition: Anogramma leptophylla is recognised by its small size, delicate and pale green fronds, glabrous laminae, and exindusiate sori extending along the veins and often covering the whole pinna segment at maturity. Cytology: n = 26 (Lovis et al. 1993). Notes: The locality on the type sheet of Gymnogramma novae-zelandiae is given in Colenso’s writing as “Tamaki Creek, Thames”, but this is almost certainly an error for “Tamaki Creek, Auckland”. In the protologue, Colenso (1845) stated that the original collection was made “in sheltered grassy spots amongst scoria, on dry volcanic hills, between Manukau Bay and Tamaki Creek, about ten miles from Auckland”. Anogramma leptophylla is subcosmopolitan in distribution. However, molecular analysis of populations from different geographic regions by Nakazato & Gastony (2003) indicated that distinct New and Old World clades could be recognised. Lovis et al. (1993) noted that populations from Europe, South Africa and New Zealand all had n = 26, whereas plants from Mexico had n = 27 or 29, suggesting a cytological difference between the two clades. If these cytological and molecular differences are supported by morphological differences, there would be a strong case for recognising two separate taxa. The type of A. leptophylla is from Spain and belongs to the Old World clade, which also includes New Zealand material. Any new name would therefore be applied only to the New World clade. 27Fig. 66 : Anogramma leptophylla . Mature plant growing terrestrially.Fig. 67 : Anogramma leptophylla .

Etymology: From the Greek cheilos (lip) and anthos (flower), a reference to the sori, which occur on the margin of the pinnae. Terrestrial or rupestral ferns. Rhizomes short- to long-creeping, scaly. Rhizome scales non-clathrate, narrowly ovate, attached at base, concolorous or bicolorous, light to dark brown. Fronds monomorphic (NZ) or rarely dimorphic (not NZ). Stipes and rachises red-brown. Laminae 2–3-pinnate (NZ) or 1- pinnate and 4–5-pinnate (not NZ), herbaceous or coriaceous, glabrous or scaly and/or hairy, sometimes farinose abaxially (not NZ). Pinnae and ultimate lamina segments not articulated to rachis and costae. Veins free (NZ) or rarely reticulate (not NZ). Sori terminating veins at lamina margin, or extending almost continuously along the margins; paraphyses present; sori ± protected by the unmodified inrolled lamina margin. Spores trilete, lacking chlorophyll; perispores verrucate, tuberculate or echinate, without an equatorial flange. Taxonomy: A genus of c. 100 species, included in the subfamily Cheilanthoideae along with Myriopteris and Pellaea (PPG 1 2016). Cheilanthes , as currently construed (Eiserhardt et al. 2011; Zhang & Yatskievych 2013; PPG 1 2016), is not monophyletic, and is in need of a comprehensive phylogenetic study to determine generic boundaries within the group. One New Zealand species was previously included in the genus Notholaena (e.g. Cheeseman 1925, as Nothochlaena ), which was first described from Australia by Brown (1810). However, the typification of Notholaena has been very controversial, and the genus is now considered to be typified by a New World species, and confined to the Americas (Yatskievych & Smith 2003; Rothfels et al. 2008; PPG 1 2016). The Australian species of Cheilanthes , including both species indigenous to New Zealand, have been extensively reviewed by Quirk et al. (1983) and Chambers & Farrant (1991, 1998), and those in southern Africa by Anthony (1984). Allan (1961) followed earlier New Zealand Flora writers in accepting three species, but one of them, C. tenuifolia , is now thought to occur in coastal regions of Queensland and Northern Territory, extending to Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, South-East Asia and the Pacific islands (Chambers & Farrant 1991).

Category Number Indigenous (Non-endemic) 2 Exotic: Casual 1 Total 3 Recognition: In New Zealand, species of Cheilanthes can be recognised by their small to medium- sized 2–3-pinnate fronds, sori extending around the lamina edges protected by the inrolled pinna margins, and scabrate to verrucate spores (Large & Braggins 1991). They occur most frequently in dry, rocky habitats. Cytology: Base chromosome numbers of x = 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30 have been recorded in Cheilanthes. There is also an extensive polyploid series from diploid to hexaploid, and several species are known to be apomictic (Tindale & Roy 2002). 2",,5-29mm-long; 9-20mm-wide; 5-60mm-long; 4-42mm-wide,,,,,,10-47mm-long,8-65mm-long,Pteridaceae,"['indigenous', 'non-endemic']"
Cheilanthes distans (R.Br.),,25-310mm-long; 400mm-long,"Cheilanthes distans grows on dry cliffs, on rocky outcrops and scoria, on lava field, in rock crevices, on roadside banks and cuttings, and on grassy hillsides, often in sunny situations. It is found under kānuka, mānuka and scrub, often in coastal areas, and sometimes in full sun. It grows on volcanic rock, greywacke, sandstone and limestone substrates. 30Together with Anogramma leptophylla , Asplenium flabellifolium , A. subglandulosum , Cheilanthes sieberi and Pellaea calidirupium , Cheilanthes distans forms a characteristic assemblage of ferns that inhabit dry rocky areas, especially in the eastern South Island. Recognition: Cheilanthes distans is easily distinguished from other New Zealand species of this genus by its abundant covering of hairs on the adaxial lamina surface and narrowly ovate, pale brown scales on the abaxial surface. The laminae are also generally shorter, narrower and less divided than in C. sieberi (12–220 mm long cf. 30–250 mm long; 6–33 mm wide cf. 6–80 mm wide). The two species frequently occur together, and both are rigidly upright ferns. Cytology: 2n = 116 (Murray & de Lange 2013). In Australia several counts indicate that plants are apomictic, with 84 univalents present at meiosis (Tindale & Roy 2002). There is also one count of 2n = c. 110 of a possibly apomictic plant (Quirk et al. 1983). Fig. 73 : Cheilanthes distans . Mature plant growing terrestrially.Fig. 74 : Cheilanthes distans .

"Cheilanthes sieberi Kunze in Lehmann, Pl. Preiss. 2, 112 (1846)",,60-445mm-long; 590mm-long,"Cheilanthes sieberi subsp. sieberi grows on dry cliffs, rocky outcrops, roadside banks, shingle, and heated ground around fumeroles, often in sunny situations. It is found under kānuka, mānuka and scrub, and in grassland, often in coastal areas, and sometimes in full sun. It grows on greywacke, lava, pumice, basalt, mica schist, and limestone substrates. Together with Anogramma leptophylla , Asplenium flabellifolium , A. subglandulosum , Cheilanthes distans and Pellaea calidirupium , Cheilanthes sieberi subsp. sieberi forms a characteristic assemblage of ferns that inhabits dry rocky areas, especially in the eastern South Island. Recognition: Cheilanthes sieberi subsp. sieberi is distinguished from C. distans by the lack of hairs on the adaxial surface, and lack of narrowly ovate scales on the abaxial lamina surface. The fronds often appear glabrous to the naked eye, but there is usually a sparse covering of short, hair-like scales on the rachis and abaxial surfaces. The laminae are also generally longer, broader and more divided than in C. distans (30–250 mm long cf. 12–220 mm long; 6–80 mm wide cf. 6–33 mm wide). The two species frequently occur together, and both are rigidly upright ferns. Cytology: Brownlie (1957) reported that Cheilanthes sieberi subsp. sieberi in New Zealand was a triploid apomictic with n = 87. In Australia, some populations are also apomictic with n = 84, but others are sexually reproducing diploids with n = 28 (Tindale & Roy 2002). Notes: Only one subspecies of Cheilanthes sieberi occurs in New Zealand. Cheilanthes sieberi subsp. pseudovellea is endemic to the arid region of central Australia. It is distinguished from subsp. sieberi by the presence of an indumentum of twisted hairs on both surfaces of the pinnules. By contrast, the adaxial surface of subsp. sieberi is glabrous, and the abaxial surface almost glabrous. Large forms of C. sieberi subsp. sieberi in New Zealand were persistently misidentified as C. tenuifolia by earlier Flora writers, and especially by Kirk (1874), who thought that both species were present in New Zealand. However C. tenuifolia is found in coastal regions of Queensland and Northern Territory, Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, South-East Asia and the Pacific islands (Chambers & Farrant 1991). Following Green (1988), the name C. humilis (G.Forst.) P.S.Green was used as an earlier name for C. sieberi by Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth (1989), but Chambers & Farrant (1991, 1998) concluded that Forster’s type was typical of C. tenuifolia rather than C. sieberi. Quirk et al. (1983) noted that examination of the type specimen of C. erecta “ shows it to be somewhat intermediate between C. sieberi subsp. sieberi and C. distans , with a narrow, mostly glabrous 33bipinnate frond which bears some scales. Spores are rounded, and of an echinate pattern most like that of C. distans ”. Fig. 80 : Cheilanthes sieberi subsp. sieberi .

"Pellaea calidirupium Brownsey & Lovis, New Zealand J. Bot. 28: 197 (1990)",55-410mm; 460mm-long; 8-40mm-long; 4-17mm-wide,30-240mm-long,"Pellaea calidirupium grows on coastal cliffs, lava fields, dry rocky outcrops, bluffs, scree and roadside banks, either in the open, in crevices, under rock overhangs, under low scrub, or in rough grassland. It is often associated with Discaria toumatou , Rubus rubiginosa , Thymus vulgaris and species of Sophora and small-leaved Coprosma . It grows on greywacke, basalt, rhyolite, scoria, lava, schist, and rarely on limestone. Together with Anogramma leptophylla , Asplenium flabellifolium , A. subglandulosum , Cheilanthes distans and C. sieberi , Pellaea calidirupium forms a characteristic assemblage of ferns that inhabit dry rocky areas, especially in the eastern South Island. Recognition: Pellaea calidirupium is distinguished from most populations of P. rotundifolia by the appressed scales on the stipes and rachises, the more obviously dimorphic fronds, generally shorter laminae (usually 30–240 mm long cf. 100–600 mm long), fewer pairs of pinnae on the fertile fronds (2–22 cf. 8–40), a sometimes enlarged terminal pinna, widely spaced proximal pinnae often borne on distinct stalks, and sori that are continuous around the pinna margins and often confluent at the apices. The fronds usually have an irregular and untidy appearance compared to the neat rows of pinnae in P. rotundifolia . The fertile pinnae are characteristically triangular, or slightly falcate, with tapering apices, in contrast to the rounded or oblong pinnae with obtuse to acute apices abruptly narrowed to a short, sharp point in P. rotundifolia . Pellaea calidirupium is less easily distinguished morphologically from populations of P. rotundifolia on the Kermadec Islands. The latter plants have more or less appressed scales on the stipes and rachises, so the distinction between the two species relies on the remaining characters outlined above. Nevertheless, on the basis of molecular evidence, P. calidirupium is clearly distinct from P. rotundifolia on the Kermadecs and the North and South Islands (Brownsey et al. 2020). Cytology: n = 58 (Brownlie 1961 – as P. falcata ; Brownsey & Lovis 1990). However, in Australia P. calidirupium has been reported as diploid with a single count of n = c. 29 from Kaputar National Park (Tindale & Roy 2002), and as triploid and tetraploid in populations from Queensland (Kokubugata et al. 2007). If this is confirmed, the status of some Australian plants may need to be reconsidered. Hybridisation: There is evidence that Pellaea calidirupium hybridises with P. rotundifolia in areas where the two species are contiguous (Brownsey & Lovis 1990), and that the hybrids have aborted spores (e.g. CHR 147559, 385976, 386678, 387589). Notes: There is a striking disjunction in the distribution of P. calidirupium in the North Island. Populations extend from the Three Kings Islands through eastern Northland to Mayor Island, but are absent along the whole Bay of Plenty and east coast, reoccurring again only in the very south of the North Island. Given the apparent suitability of habitat along the eastern coast, further investigation is needed to determine if the absence is real. There are no obvious morphological differences between the two groups, and spore measurements suggest that they are uniformly tetraploid (Brownsey et al. 2020). 40Fig. 95 : Pellaea calidirupium .

Pellaea rotundifolia (G.Forst.),6-42mm-long; 4-16mm-wide,110-870mm-long,"Pellaea rotundifolia occurs in podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, under pines and other introduced trees, under mānuka, kānuka and scrub, and amongst grasses. It is found on stony banks, clay banks, rocky outcrops, coastal cliffs and scree, amongst boulders, on streambanks, river terraces, tracksides, roadsides, bush margins, swamp margins and at the base of tree trunks. It grows on greywacke, scoria, lava, andesite, rhyolite, schist, sandstone and limestone substrates, peat and sand. Recognition: Plants of Pellaea rotundifolia on the main islands of New Zealand are distinguished from P. calidirupium by the presence of spreading scales on the stipes and rachises, less obviously dimorphic fronds, generally longer laminae (100–600 mm long cf. 30–240 mm long), more pairs of pinnae on the fertile fronds (8–40 cf. 2–22), absence of an enlarged terminal pinna, less widely spaced proximal pinnae usually lacking distinct stalks, and sori that extend around the pinna margins but are not confluent at the apices. The fronds usually have neat rows of pinnae compared to the irregular and untidy appearance of those in P. calidirupium . The fertile pinnae are rounded or oblong, with obtuse to acute apices abruptly narrowed to a short sharp point, unlike those in P. calidirupium , which are characteristically triangular, or slightly falcate, with tapering apices.  Plants of P. rotundifolia on the Kermadec Islands are slightly different morphologically to those on the main islands in having more appressed stipe and rachis scales, although not as consistently as those in P. calidirupium . Distinguishing the two species relies on the other characters outlined above. However, molecular evidence shows that P. rotundifolia on both the Kermadecs and the North and South Islands is distinct from P. calidirupium (Brownsey et al. 2020). Cytology: n = 58 (Brownlie 1954, 1957). Hybridisation: There is evidence that Pellaea rotundifolia hybridises with P. calidirupium in areas where the two species occur together (Brownsey & Lovis 1990), and that the hybrids have aborted spores (e.g. CHR 147559, 385976, 386678, 387589). Notes: There are genetic and subtle morphological differences between populations of P. rotundifolia on the Kermadecs and those in the rest of New Zealand, suggesting different origins for the two groups. However, the exact nature of these evolutionary origins is unresolved at the present time, and the morphological differences inadequately understood (Brownsey et al. 2020). The Australian species Pellaea nana (Hook.) Bostock is morphologically very similar to P. rotundifolia. However, chloroplast DNA sequence data show that it is genetically distinct from both Australian P. falcata and New Zealand P. rotundifolia (Brownsey et al. 2020). 43Fig. 104 : Pellaea rotundifolia .

Pl. 1073 (1753) Type taxon: Pteris longifolia Etymology: From the Greek pteris (feathery), the Greek name for a fern. Terrestrial or rupestral ferns. Rhizomes erect to short-creeping, scaly. Rhizome scales non-clathrate, narrowly ovate, attached at the base, concolorous or with dark centres and pale margins, pale brown to blackish. Fronds monomorphic. Stipes and rachises pale brown to red-brown, or occasionally green. Laminae 1-pinnate to 4-pinnate-pinnatifid (NZ) or 5-pinnate (not NZ), sometimes pedate (NZ) or palmate (not NZ); herbaceous or coriaceous, glabrous or hairy and/or scaly. Pinnae and ultimate lamina segments not articulated to rachis and costae. Veins free or reticulate, the areolae without free included veinlets. Sori extending along the margins; paraphyses present; sori protected by the membranous, reflexed, lamina margin. Spores trilete, lacking chlorophyll; perispores coarsely ridged, tuberculate or reticulate with an equatorial flange. Taxonomy: A genus of c. 250 species, included in the subfamily Pteridoideae along with Anogramma (PPG 1 2016). There is no modern monograph of Pteris world-wide, and no clear indication of natural subgeneric groups based on morphology. Phylogenetic analysis by Zhang et al. (2015), based on six plastid loci, indicated that the genus is monophyletic, with 15 different clades recognised world-wide. A more extensive survey of 178 species by Zhang & Zhang (2018), using one nuclear and eight plastid genes, recovered 16 clades. Based on this study, Zhang & Zhang recognised 15 sections in three subgenera, one of them monotypic. Four of the five indigenous New Zealand species fell into subgenus Campteria section Tripedipteris. One of the subclades within this section comprises seven Oceanian species with anastomosing veins, including P. carsei (as P. comans ), P. macilenta and P. saxatilis from New Zealand; P. epaleata (as P. comans ) from Australia and New Zealand; P. microptera Mett. ex Kuhn from Lord Howe Island; and two other Pacific species. The fifth indigenous species, P. tremula , forms a small clade with the South American P. chilensis Desv. in which the laminae are 3–4-pinnatifid and the veins free. This is subgenus Campteria, section Tremulae. Allan (1961) recognised three species in New Zealand – P. comans G.Forst. , P. macilenta and P. tremula , with P. saxatilis treated as a variety of P. macilenta . Walker (1962) investigated the species with anastomosing veins cytologically and reported that P. comans and P. saxatilis were diploid species with 2n = 58, and that P. macilenta was a tetraploid species with 2n = c. 116. The genus in New Zealand was the subject of an unpublished Ph.D. thesis by Braggins (1975). He suggested that the New Zealand plant treated by previous authors as P. comans was an endemic species distinct from other members of the complex, and it has subsequently been described as P. carsei (Brownsey et al. 2020). Braggins (1975) also suggested that the type of P. macilenta was actually a specimen of what was being called P. saxatilis , and that the correct names for these two species should be P. pendula and P. macilenta , respectively. However, reassessment of potential type material in P has shown that the only original material is, in fact, a specimen of P. macilenta , and that the names P. macilenta and P. saxatilis should be used in their traditional sense (Brownsey & Perrrie 2020). 45Following the recognition of P. carsei as a New Zealand endemic, distinct from P. comans sens. str. in the tropical Pacific, Ohlsen et al. (2020) described Australian plants, previously referred to P. comans , as P. epaleata . This species extends to New Zealand, with a few populations known from southern Fiordland. Several species of Pteris are established in the horticultural trade and have become naturalised around the world. Seven naturalised species, P. argyraea , P. cretica , P. dentata , P. multifida , P. pacifica , P. parkeri and P. vittata , have been added to the New Zealand flora in the last 40 years. 1 Lamina veins anastomosing ....................................................................................................2 Lamina veins free ....................................................................................................................5 2 Scales absent on rachises and pinna costae, or if present, very narrow and hair-like ................................................................................................................ epaleata Scales present on rachises and pinna costae, ovate, not hair-like ..............................3 3 1–2 pairs of basal basiscopic secondary pinnae on lowermost primary pinnae greatly extended; all except 1–2 secondary pinnae on proximal primary pinnae adnate to costae .................................................................................... carsei Basal basiscopic pinnae on lowermost primary pinnae not greatly extended; most secondary pinnae on proximal primary pinnae distinctly stalked ....................4 4 Primary and secondary pinnae very widely spaced; laminae 100–500 mm long, 35–300 mm wide; secondary pinnae 12–85 mm long, 6–35 mm wide; tertiary pinnae 4–24 mm long and 2–12 mm wide; exospore size 32–37 μm in diameter* ................................................................................................ saxatilis Primary and secondary pinnae less widely spaced; laminae 130–900 mm long, 60–750 mm wide; secondary pinnae 16–290 mm long, 8–160 mm wide; tertiary pinnae 9–85 mm long, 3–60 mm wide; exospore size 41–46 μm in diameter* .......................................................................................................... macilenta 5 Primary pinnae bicolorous, with prominent white or yellow-green bands along their centres ..................................................................................................................5 Primary pinnae concolorous, lacking prominent white or yellow-green bands along their centres ........................................................................................................6 6 Distal primary pinnae deeply pinnatifid, with white bands along their centres ........................................................................................................................ argyraea Distal primary pinnae undivided, with yellow-green bands along their centres ............................................................................................................................ parkeri 7 Laminae 1–2-pinnate at base ..................................................................................................8 Laminae 3–4-pinnate at base ................................................................................................10 8 Proximal primary pinnae undivided .................................................................................. vittata Proximal primary pinnae divided or forked ..............................................................................9 9 Proximal primary pinnae with at least one pair of secondary pinnae arising on both sides .................................................................................................... multifida Proximal primary pinnae with 1–3 secondary pinnae on basiscopic side only .............. cretica 10 Laminae 1-pinnate-pinnatifid at their mid-point; spine-like outgrowths on adaxial surface of costae of primary pinnae ..........................................................................11 Lamina usually 2-pinnate-pinnatifid at their mid-point; spine-like outgrowths absent from costae of primary pinnae ........................................................ tremula 11 Secondary pinnae on primary pinnae at mid-point of lamina <12 mm long, all about equal in length, decreasing only slightly distally ............................................ pacifica Secondary pinnae on primary pinnae at mid-point of lamina >12 mm long, decreasing markedly in length distally .......................................................................... dentata * Exospore measurements are the range of mean values for sampled individuals. Distribution: Pteris is world-wide in distribution, occurring in tropical and temperate regions of all continents except Antarctica (Zhang et al. 2015). Its greatest diversity is in eastern Asia, with 78 46species recorded in China alone (Liao et al. 2013); six indigenous and one naturalised species in southern Africa (Crouch et al. 2011), eight indigenous and two naturalised species in Australia (Kramer & McCarthy 1998), and 18 in the south-west Pacific (Nakamura 2008). Twelve species in New Zealand; five indigenous and seven naturalised, three endemic. Biostatus: Indigenous (Non-endemic). Table 7 : Number of species in New Zealand within Pteris L.

The spores are trilete, and coarsely tuberculate or cristate (Large & Braggins 1991).

"Pteris carsei Braggins & Brownsey in Brownsey et al., New Zealand J. Bot. 58: 216 (2020)",,380-1430mm-long,"Pteris carsei is a terrestrial fern found in open coastal sites, in coastal forest under Metrosideros excelsa , Kunzea spp., and other coastal broadleaved species. It favours rocky streambeds and streamsides, rocky forest, cliffs, hillsides and beach fronts near the sea. Recognition: Pteris carsei is distinguished by its erect rhizome, laminae that are shiny green adaxially, and 1-pinnate-pinnatifid distally to 2-pinnate-pinnatifid or rarely 3-pinnate proximally, anastomosing veins, overlapping pinnae, broad coriaceous ultimate segments, and secondary pinnae that are mostly adnate or sessile on the lowermost primary pinnae. The species is believed to hybridise with both P. macilenta and P. saxatilis , making identification difficult in coastal areas of northern New Zealand. However, the greatly extended basal basiscopic secondary pinnae, and the mostly adnate secondary pinnae on the lower primary pinnae, distinguish P. carsei from P. macilenta and P. saxatilis . It differs from P. epaleata by its dark shiny green, rather than dull yellow-green, adaxial lamina surface, less divided lamina, and presence of ovate, rather than hair-like, scales on the rachis and pinna costae. P. carsei occurs in the northern half of the North Island, whereas P. epaleata is confined to southern Fiordland. Cytology: n = 30 (Brownlie 1961); 2n = 58 (Walker 1962). Hybridisation: Pteris carsei is known to hybridise with P. saxatilis in coastal areas of Northland and Auckland, often forming extensive hybrid swarms when the two occur together (see suites of material in AK). Spores of putative hybrids are sometimes abnormal in appearance, but aborted spores are not as easy to detect as in genera such as Asplenium or Polystichum . There may be some degree of fertility in hybrids between Pteris carsei and P. saxatilis , and back-crosses to both parents could be possible. Whether P. carsei also crosses with P. macilenta is not known with certainty. The two hybrid combinations with P. carsei are almost impossible to distinguish morphologically in herbarium material, but hybrids between P. carsei and P. macilenta are likely to have aborted spores because of the difference in chromosome number. Braggins (1975) created artificial hybrids between the diploid species, P. carsei and P. saxatilis , and it is probable on morphological grounds that P. macilenta is an allotetraploid derivative of wild hybrids between the two diploid species. However, experimental evidence for this is lacking, and all three species have very similar chloroplast DNA sequences, indicating a close relationship (Bouma et al. 2010). Notes: Brownsey et al. (2020) showed that P. carsei is an endemic species distinct from P. comans and other species in the tropical Pacific. Pteris comans sens. str. occurs in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji and may also occur on New Caledonia, Samoa and elsewhere in the Pacific. Pteris zahlbruckneriana (syn. P. endlicheriana J.Ag.) from Norfolk Island, and P. microptera from Lord Howe Island, both belong in the P. comans complex, but are distinct from P. carsei (Braggins 1975; Green 1994b; Brownsey et al. 2020). The status of plants referred to the poorly known P. laevis Mett. from New Caledonia and P. litoralis Rech.f. from Samoa and Vanuatu require further investigation. 49Fig. 115 : Pteris carsei .

Recognition: Pteris epaleata is superficially most similar to P. tremula in its frond dissection, absence of scales on the lamina, and its dull green adaxial lamina surface. However, it is clearly distinct from that species in having anastomosing rather than free veins. It differs from P. carsei in having less coriaceous and more divided laminae, narrower ultimate segments, dull green rather than shiny adaxial lamina surfaces, hair-like rather than ovate scales on the rachises and costae, and lacking the greatly extended basiscopic secondary pinnae on the basal primary pinnae. From P. macilenta and P. saxatilis it differs in having secondary pinnae that are less obviously stalked, ultimate segments that are longer and narrower, and hair-like rather than ovate scales on the rachises and costae. Cytology: No chromosome count has been made on New Zealand material, but 2n = 58 was reported by Tindale & Roy (2002 – as P. comans ) from two populations in New South Wales. Notes: The description of P. epaleata in New Zealand given here is incomplete because it is based on only three collections. A full description of the species throughout its range has been provided by Ohlsen et al. (2020), and, if more collections are made in New Zealand, it is likely that the known dimensions will more closely approximate those in Australia. Pteris epaleata is morphologically, genetically and geographically distinct from P. comans sens. str. in the tropical Pacific. It is also morphologically distinct from P. zahlbruckneriana Endl. on Norfolk Island and P. microptera on Lord Howe Island (Ohlsen et al. 2020). Observations by field botanists in southern Fiordland, albeit unsupported by voucher specimens, suggest that Pteris epaleata may be more widespread (B. Rance, pers. comm. 17.3.2020). Its occurrence in Fiordland and south-eastern Australia is similar to that of Sticherus tener (Brownsey et al. 2013). 55Fig. 132 : Pteris epaleata .

"Pteris macilenta A.Rich., Essai Fl. Nouv.-Zél., 82, t. 12 (1832)",,200-1550mm-long; 1800mm-long,"Pteris macilenta is a terrestrial fern found under coastal forest, drier and more open kauri, podocarp, beech, and broadleaved forest, and mānuka and kānuka scrub. It is also found under Carex secta . It grows on scoria, greywacke and limestone rock, favouring streambanks, river terraces, wet gullies, clay banks, clearings, forest margins, roadside banks, coastal cliffs, and the bases of rocky bluffs. Recognition: Pteris macilenta is distinguished by its erect rhizome, deeply 2-pinnate-pinnatifid to 4 ‑pinnate ‑pinnatifid laminae, anastomosing veins, non-overlapping pinnae, usually herbaceous lamina segments, and secondary pinnae that are mostly stalked on the lowermost primary pinnae. It is very similar to P. saxatilis , but is generally a larger plant with slightly more coriaceous laminae and less widely spaced pinnae. The secondary pinnae on the lower primary pinnae are more obviously alternate rather than sub-opposite. It also has larger spores than those in P. saxatilis (exospores 41–46 μm, cf. 32–37 μm in diameter). Plants of P. macilenta are believed to hybridise with both P. saxatilis and P. carsei , making identification difficult in areas where the species overlap. It differs from P. epaleata in having secondary pinnae that are more obviously stalked, ultimate segments that are shorter and broader, and scales on the rachises and costae that are ovate rather than hair-like. Cytology: n = 60 (Brownlie 1961); n = 58, 2n = c. 116 (Walker 1962); 2n = c. 120 (de Lange et al. 2004 – as P. aff. macilenta ). Hybridisation: Pteris macilenta is believed to hybridise with P. saxatilis in areas where they overlap (e.g. AK 353155, 353276, 353488, CHR 210968, 292779). Spores of putative hybrids are often abnormal in appearance because of the difference in chromosome number between the two species, but are not as easy to detect as in genera such as Asplenium or Polystichum . Whether P. macilenta also crosses with P. carsei is not known with certainty because it is difficult to distinguish this combination from the common hybrid between P. saxatilis and P. carsei . It is likely on morphological grounds that P. macilenta is an allotetraploid derivative of the two diploid species, although experimental evidence for this is lacking, and all three species have very similar chloroplast DNA sequences, indicating a close relationship (Bouma et al. 2010). Notes: Braggins (1975), in his unpublished thesis, interpreted Richard’s P. macilenta to be the correct name for the plant subsequently known as P. saxatilis , and proposed that P. pendula , described by Colenso (1888), be used for the plant that had been called P. macilenta. Although his thesis was never published, the names P. pendula and P. macilenta were adopted by some collectors, whereas others continued to use P. macilenta and P. saxatilis . As a consequence, the names have been used in different senses, and a significant amount of herbarium material was confusingly identified. Brownsey & Perrrie (2020) selected the only element that is definitely original material of Richard's name as the lectotype (P 00610503), and since this is a specimen of what is currently called P. macilenta , the name is retained in its traditional sense. Plants growing in limestone areas from the Heaphy Track south to Greymouth, especially around Punakaiki, have rather fleshy fronds, and primary pinnae that are more winged than in populations elsewhere. They also have a mean exospore size (36–41 μm diameter) intermediate between those of the tetraploid P. macilenta (41–46 μm diameter) and the diploid P. saxatilis (32–37 μm diameter) and P. carsei (33–36 μm diameter). These plants may be an environmental form, or they may represent 57allotetraploid plants that have had a separate origin from populations elsewhere. They are not given any taxonomic status here, but require further investigation. Fig. 135 : Pteris macilenta .

Pteris saxatilis (Carse),,145-700mm-long,"Pteris saxatilis is a terrestrial fern that grows under coastal forest and scrub, and in drier kauri, broadleaved forest, and mānuka and kānuka scrub. It is found on coastal cliffs, on creek banks, in damp gullies, on clay and grassy banks, and amongst rocks and scree, occurring on both greywacke and limestone rock. Recognition: Pteris saxatilis is distinguished by its erect rhizome, 2-pinnate to 3-pinnate-pinnatifid laminae, anastomosing veins, widely spaced pinnae, herbaceous ultimate segments, and secondary pinnae that are mostly stalked on the lowermost primary pinnae. It is very similar to P. macilenta but is generally a smaller plant with a more delicate lamina and more widely spaced pinnae. The secondary pinnae on the lower primary pinnae are more obviously sub-opposite rather than alternate. It also has smaller spores than those in P. macilenta (exospores 32–37 μm, cf. 41–46 μm in diameter). Plants of P. saxatilis are believed to hybridise with both P. macilenta and P. carsei , making identification difficult in areas where the species overlap. Cytology: 2n = 58 (Walker 1962). Hybridisation: Pteris saxatilis is believed to hybridise with both P. carsei and P. macilenta , especially in coastal areas of Northland and Auckland. Extensive hybrid swarms with P. carsei are known in several localities (see suites of material in AK). Spores of putative hybrids are sometimes abnormal in appearance, but are not as easy to detect as in genera such as Asplenium or Polystichum . There may be some degree of fertility in hybrids between P. saxatilis and P. carsei , and back-crosses to both parents could be possible. Hybrids between P. saxatilis and P. macilenta are less common, but are more likely to have aborted spores because of the difference in chromosome number (e.g. AK 353155, 353276, 353488). Braggins (1975) created artificial hybrids between the diploid species, P. saxatilis and P. carsei , and it is likely on morphological grounds that P. macilenta is an allotetraploid derivative of wild hybrids between these two diploid species.

"Pteris tremula R.Br., Prodr. Fl. Nov. Holland. 154 (1810)",,220-2440mm-long,"Pteris tremula is found under coastal forest and scrub, open broadleaved and beech forest, kānuka and mānuka scrub, and in open pine plantations. It also occurs on forest margins, under regenerating scrub, in reverting pasture, on wooded sand-dunes, at the base of cliffs, and as a weed in gardens. It favours streambanks, the base of waterfalls, river terraces, bush clearings, open forest floor, roadside banks, rocky hillsides, and swamp margins. It occurs on greywacke, limestone and scoria. It is sometimes common in heavily grazed areas because the fronds are unpalatable to stock. 65Recognition: Pteris tremula is distinguished by its erect rhizome, 2-pinnate-pinnatifid to almost 4- pinnate laminae, free veins, herbaceous texture, long narrow ultimate segments, and laminae lacking scales but sometimes with minute hairs along the costae. It is more divided, with more pairs of primary pinnae, than most other species in New Zealand. It could be confused with P. epaleata in overall morphology but differs significantly in having free veins rather than anastomosing venation. Cytology: n = c. 120 (Brownlie 1957). Hybridisation: Pteris tremula is not known to hybridise with any other species in New Zealand. Notes: Pteris novae-zelandiae was described by Field (1906) from material received in a “parcel of ferns from Waikanae”. He compared it with P. tremula but noted that it differed most obviously in its growth form – spreading horizontally by the production of lateral fronds, rather than being erect. No original material has been located and it is impossible to determine the identity of the plant from the description alone. The name was not documented by either Cheeseman (1925) or Allan (1961) and, in any case, was not validly published because Field stated only that “it may be provisionally named Pteris novae-zelandiae ”. Provisional names are not considered to be validly published (see Art. 36.1, Ex. 5). Fig. 157 : Pteris tremula .

It often occurs with species of Spirodela , Wolffia , Lemna , Landoltia , Ludwigia and Potamogeton , and occasionally with A. pinnata , sometimes amongst Typha orientalis , Carex secta or Salix species, or on open water. Recognition: Azolla rubra is readily distinguished from A. pinnata by its irregular branching and by its roots that lack fine rootlets. Azolla rubra is currently the only species that occurs in the South Island, but the southward spread of A. pinnata into the Wellington region suggests that it may soon cross Cook Strait. Cytology: No count has been made from New Zealand material of Azolla rubra , but 2n = 44 has been reported for Australian material (Tindale & Roy 2002). Notes: In New Zealand, this plant was treated as A. rubra by Allan (1961) and by all previous Flora writers. However, following Svenson (1944), the name A. filiculoides was adopted for the New Zealand plant by Brownsey et al. (1985) and Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth (2000), and for the Australian plant by Chinnock (1998). In a detailed investigation of the genus, Reid et al. (2006) showed that A. filiculoides and A. rubra can be distinguished on both morphological characters and molecular differences. Metzgar et al. (2007) confirmed that the two are closely related sister taxa that are themselves sister to a clade containing the remaining American species. The name A. rubra was therefore reinstated by Brownsey & Perrie (2013) as a species native to Australia and New Zealand, and sister to the American A. filiculoides . 5Fig. 6 : Azolla rubra : plants floating on the surface of standing water with irregularly branched stems bearing densely imbricate bilobed floating leavesFig. 7 : Azolla rubra : plants floating on the surface of standing water showing the upper lobes of bilobed floating leaves, tinged red.

Salvinia Ség., Pl. Veron. 3, 52 (1754) Type taxon: Salvinia natans (L.) All. Etymology: Named in honour of Professor Antonio Maria Salvini (1633-1722), botanist and Greek scholar from Florence. Aquatic ferns, free-floating. Stems short, branching, hairy, lacking roots. Leaves dimorphic, arranged in whorls of 3; each group comprising two floating, green, entire, foliar leaves, and one submerged, highly divided leaf appearing root-like; upper surface of foliar leaves bearing specialised water- repellent hairs; lower surface of foliar leaves and the submerged leaves bearing multicellular hairs. Veins anastomosing without free included veinlets. Sporocarps attached to the submerged leaves, subsessile or stalked, globose to ovoid; each sporocarp bearing either mega- or microsporangia. Sporangia usually empty in NZ plants; when fertile (not NZ), megaspores solitary in each megasporangium; microspores 32–64 in each microsporangium. Spores absent or aborted in NZ plants; when formed (not NZ) megaspores spheroidal, plain, perforate; microspores spheroidal, plain to rugulate. Distribution: 10–12 species widespread in tropical regions, extending also into temperate areas, with two centres of distribution in Africa, and in South and Central America (Schneller 1990b); some species have become tropical weeds.

Category Number Exotic: Fully Naturalised 1 Total 1 Cytology: x = 9 (Schneller 1990b), the lowest base chromosome number known in ferns (Smith et al. 2006). Notes: The taxonomy of neotropical species was outlined by Mitchell & Thomas (1972) and adopted by Tryon & Tryon (1982). Following the initial investigation, Salvinia ×molesta was described as a new species (Mitchell 1972). It belongs to a small group of South American taxa, including S. auriculata and S. biloba (syn. S. herzogii , see de la Sota 1995), in which the hairs at the end of the leaf papillae are joined at their distal ends. Based on analysis of five different genes, Nagalingum et al. (2008) showed that Salvinia comprises two Eurasian and American groups, although only the American clade, which includes S. ×molesta , is strongly supported. Plants of Salvinia are free-floating and capable of covering large areas of slow-moving or still water. In New Zealand, sporocarps are rare and are usually empty when found, and reproduction is vegetative. Spores of American species are illustrated by Tryon & Lugardon (1991).

Vernacular names: Kariba weed; salvinia Aquatic fern, forming free-floating dense mats, with leaves tightly overlapping. Floating leaves broadly elliptic to orbicular when young, becoming broader than long at maturity, 12–30 mm long, 15–50 mm wide, often conduplicately folded along the midrib; apex emarginate; margins entire, sometimes inrolled; base cordate, shortly stalked; upper surface light or brownish-green, becoming darker on the margins, densely covered in papillae each bearing 2 or 4 uniseriate hairs united at their distal ends (shaped like an egg-whisk); papillae up to 3 mm long. Submerged leaves branched, 25–300 mm long, densely covered in brown septate hairs 1–3 mm long. Fertile axes on submerged leaves 15–70 mm long, bearing 4–20 pairs of sporocarps arranged in 2 rows.

It can also occur on near vertical mossy banks and rock faces. On Table Mountain, Coromandel and Mt Hobson, Great Barrier Island, it is epiphytic on Metrosideros and Agathis in open forest in extremely boggy areas. At lower elevations it is found on pākihi soils. Recognition: Schizaea australis is closely related to S. fistulosa but differs in its shorter fronds (20–350 mm cf. 115–570 mm long), shorter fertile portions of the frond (3–17 mm cf. 9–38 mm long), fewer pairs of fertile branches (4–13 cf. 7–30 pairs), its montane and more southerly distribution, and its generally more slender habit and twisted sterile portions of the frond. The distributions of the two species overlap on Great Barrier Island, Mt Moehau, and in north-west Nelson, but only in north-west Nelson are populations frequently found in the same altitudinal range. S. fistulosa is distinct from S. australis in having twice as many chromosomes (n = c.190 cf. n = 94). This ploidy difference is reflected in the size of the guard cells of the stomata, which are arranged in long vertical lines on the sterile portions of the frond and are visible under a dissecting microscope. The guard cells are 126–180 μm long in S. fistulosa compared with 81–114 μm long in S. australis (Brownsey & Perrie 2013). Cytology: n = 94 (Brownlie 1965; Lash 1966). Hybridisation: There is some cytological evidence for hybridisation between S. australis and S. fistulosa (Brownsey et al. 1985). Lash (1966) reported n = 94 for several populations of S. australis from north-west Nelson, and n = c.150 for other populations from the same area with generally larger plants. Reinterpretation of Lash’s illustrated cell suggested the presence of at least some univalents (Brownsey et al. 1985), and the possibility of hybridisation causing failure of pairing. A chromosome count of n = c.190 has been reported for S. fistulosa from Auckland (Brownsey et al. 1985; Dawson et al. 2000). Lash’s count of c.150 is consistent with the possibility of hybridisation between S. fistulosa and S. australis in north-west Nelson where both species are known to occur. 4Fig. 2 : Schizaea australis : mature plant growing on wet, pākihi soil.Fig. 3 : Schizaea australis : mature plant growing amongst taller vegetation, showing undivided sterile portions.

It is hard to find, even where abundant, because of its inconspicuous frond, and is becoming scarcer as its scrub habitats are cleared for farming or forestry. Recognition: When well-grown, Schizaea bifida is easily recognised by its dichotomously branching sterile frond portions, which are distinguished from those of S. dichotoma by being terete rather than flattened. Plants with undivided sterile portions of the frond are similar to S. fistulosa but can be distinguished by their scabrid rather than smooth texture, by the longer fertile branches (3–13 mm cf. 2–5 mm long), and by the presence of hairs amongst the sporangia.

"Schizaea fistulosa Labill., Nov. Holl. Pl. 2, 103, t. 250, fig. 3 (1807)",,115-570mm-long; 2-5mm-wide; 100-550mm-long; 0.5-1.0mm; 126-180μm-long; 9-30mm-long; 38mm-long; 2-5mm-wide; 2-5mm-long,"A terrestrial fern that grows in lowland areas on gumland and poor clay or sandy soils, pākihi, or sometimes on hummocks in Sphagnum bog, either in the open, under light mānuka, kānuka or Hakea scrub, or in open kauri forest. It sometimes grows in moss cushions under scrub, and on heated ground in the Rotorua/Taupō region. Recognition: Schizaea fistulosa is closely related to S. australis but differs in its longer fronds (115–570 mm cf. 20–350 mm long), longer fertile portions of the frond (9–38 mm cf. 3–17 mm long), more pairs of fertile branches (7–30 cf. 4–13 pairs), its generally lowland and more northerly distribution, and its habit of producing relatively robust, straight, tall fronds, often amongst other vegetation. The distributions of the two species overlap on Great Barrier Island, Mt Moehau, and in north-west Nelson, but only in north-west Nelson are populations frequently found in the same altitudinal range. S. fistulosa is distinct from S. australis in having twice as many chromosomes (n = c.190 cf. n = 94). This ploidy difference is reflected in the size of the guard cells of the stomata, which are arranged in long vertical lines on the sterile laminal segments and visible under a dissecting microscope. The guard cells are 126–180 μm long in S. fistulosa compared with 81–114 μm long in S. australis (Brownsey & Perrie 2013). Cytology: n = c.190 (Brownsey et al. 1985; Dawson et al. 2000); n = c.270 (Brownlie 1965). The latter count may have been an erroneous count from a tapetal cell (see Brownsey et al. 1985). 9Hybridisation: There is some cytological evidence for hybridisation between S. australis and S. fistulosa (Brownsey et al. 1985). Lash (1966) reported n = 94 for several populations of S. australis from north-west Nelson, and n = c.150 for other populations from the same area with generally larger plants. Reinterpretation of Lash’s illustrated cell suggested the presence of at least some univalents (Brownsey et al. 1985), and the possibility of hybridisation causing failure of pairing. Lash’s count of c.150 is consistent with hybridisation between S. fistulosa and S. australis in north-west Nelson where both species are known to occur. Fig. 13 : Schizaea fistulosa : mature plant.

Arthropteris tenella (G.Forst.),,85-560mm-long,"Arthropteris tenella often scrambles over rocks, boulders and stumps before climbing a tree trunk and forming fertile fronds. It is most commonly found in coastal and broad-leaved forest, or sometimes in kauri or podocarp forest or under tall kānuka. It frequently grows on limestone but also on greywacke, basalt, lava, scoria and other acidic rock. It favours rocky ground under forest, in stream beds, on river terraces, in gorges and gullies, and on forest margins. Recognition: Mature plants of Arthropteris tenella are recognised by their long-climbing rhizomes, pinnate fronds, narrowly ovate and shallowly lobed pinnae jointed to the rachis, and round exindusiate sori near the lamina margins. Measurements in the description are for fertile fronds only. Juvenile plants are frequently found climbing over rocks and boulders, and bear much smaller sterile fronds with fewer pairs of shorter pinnae; fronds on such plants are occasionally bipinnate. Larger fertile fronds are rarely produced until the rhizome climbs a tree trunk. Plants from the Three Kings Islands have sterile fronds with ovate pinnae up to 63 mm long and 18 mm wide (e.g. AK 353108, which is larger than any seen elsewhere, although the fertile pinnae are within the range for the species). Cytology: n = c. 42 (Brownlie 1958). Notes: Arthropteris tenella is closely related to A. submarginalis from Queensland (Zhang et al. 2016), differing in its larger frond and exindusiate sori.

Christella dentata (Forssk.),,340-1195mm-long,"On the Kermadec Islands Christella dentata grows in Metrosideros forest, clearings, scrub, open grassland, pumice banks, under overhanging cliffs, disturbed areas, in swampy sites and at the entrance to petrel burrows with Hypolepis dicksonioides . Around Kaitāia and Te Paki it occurs very locally in disturbed and cattle-trampled sites in coastal wetland, on river banks, in streambeds, along roadsides, in drains, under rawiri ( Kunzea linearis ) forest and in alluvial podocarp forest. In geothermal areas on Raoul Island and the Rotorua/Taupō district it occurs on heated soil, beside hot streams and mud pools, often under mānuka and kānuka in sheltered places or in weedy vegetation. In the western Waikato it was recorded from kahikatea forest. Naturalised plants grow under willows and in disturbed or urban environments. Recognition: Christella dentata is recognised by its herbaceous fronds, primary pinnae divided ⅓ to ¾ to the midrib with obtuse to truncate segments, basal pair of pinnae shortened, veins in adjacent segments joining, indumentum on the abaxial surfaces comprising acicular hairs and tiny capitate hairs but lacking scales, and indusia bearing acicular hairs. The rhizomes are creeping (up to 1 m long recorded in wild populations, de Lange, iNaturalist observation #1463496) to erect (up to 1 m tall, recorded by de Lange, AK 314009), and the fronds arise in tufts at or near the apices, with very short distances between adjacent stipes. This contrasts with the longer-creeping rhizomes with more widely spaced fronds in Cyclosorus interruptus and Thelypteris confluens . Cytology: n = 72 ( Brownlie 1961 , as Cyclosorus nymphalis , Taupō); 2n = 144 ( de Lange et al. 2004 , Foley’s Bush, Awanui). Notes: Allan (1961) recognised only a single species of Christella in New Zealand (as Thelypteris dentata ). Given (1981) suggested that plants from thermal areas might be different to those from around Kaitāia, which he related to "" C. dentata of the tropics"", but did not elaborate on how they could be distinguished. Brownsey et al. (1985) listed two taxa, C. dentata and C. sp., stating that ""two species of Christella may occur in New Zealand, one in thermal areas and the Kermadec Islands, and one in north Auckland"". Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth (1989) distinguished the thermal plant by its 5shorter rhizome and smaller frond compared to Northland plants but noted that ""its taxonomic status and affinities are not yet determined"". De Lange et al. ( 2010 ) stated that ""populations of Christella from geothermally active parts of the North Island and from the crater region of Raoul Island lack the long, creeping rhizome typical of northern New Zealand and most Raoul Island C. dentata , instead producing over time a small, erect trunk. These plants also have narrower, hairier fronds."" They concluded that ""these plants are not the same as C. dentata , and appear to represent another possibly unnamed variant"" but cautioned that further research was still needed. The taxonomic status of the two forms of C. dentata has been re-evaluated by Brownsey & Perrie (2016a) . From an analysis of the frond and rhizome morphology, spore size and cytology they found that the only difference between them was the nature of the rhizome and that, in contradiction to Brownsey & Smith-Dodsworth (1989) , there were no quantitative frond measurements that could be used to distinguish two taxa. The available evidence strongly suggested that populations in New Zealand are uniformly tetraploid and that there were no differences in investigated DNA sequences between the two forms. Furthermore, they found that the rhizomes, whether creeping or erect, were fundamentally similar in producing tufts of fronds near the apex, rather than fronds that are widely spread along the rhizome (as in families with long-creeping rhizomes such as Dennstaedtiaceae, Hymenophyllaceae or Polypodiaceae). They suggested that the nature of the rhizome may not be of great taxonomic significance, and simply a reflection of different habitats in which the plants are found. Plants in Australia show similar variation. Brownsey & Perrie (2016a) concluded that ""there is only one rather variable species indigenous to New Zealand, similar to that in Australia, which is correctly identified as Christella dentata . The picture is complicated by the presence of plants in New Zealand with distinctive purple stipes that are very similar to plants that are naturalised in Hawai‘i and the Neotropics. It is likely that they have naturalised in New Zealand as escapes from cultivated plants originally introduced from overseas. The earliest record is a plant grown from spore collected near Kāwhia in 1987 (AK 212348), but several others have been collected since 1991. Given its history in the Americas, the plant could spread in New Zealand unless carefully controlled. Fig. 2 : Christella dentata . Mature plant growing at Te Huka Bay, Northland.

Cyclosorus interruptus (Willd.),,225-1450mm-long,"Occurs in swamps, on peaty soils and lake margins in the northern part of its distribution, and on heated soil near hot springs and streams, or in swamps, in geothermal regions, sometimes under mānuka, and kānuka. In the Waikato it is also found under willows ( Salix cinerea and S. fragilis ). It is often associated with Typha orientalis , Phormium tenax , Isachne globosa , Machaerina juncea , 8Carex spp., Juncus spp., Schoenus brevifolius , Thelypteris confluens and Blechnum minus , and with Christella dentata , Lycopodiella cernua and Nephrolepis flexuosa in thermal areas. Recognition: Cyclosorus interruptus is recognised by its long-creeping rhizomes, erect and leathery fronds, primary pinnae divided one-third to halfway to the midrib with acute segments, basal pair of pinnae not shortened, veins in adjacent segments joining, indumentum on the abaxial lamina surfaces comprising broad scales, acicular hairs and spherical orange glands, and indusia usually bearing acicular hairs or sometimes glabrous. Plants vary considerably in size; the largest, with greatly extended stipes (longer than the laminae), occur in swamps in the Far North, whilst stunted plants are found on thermal soils in the central North Island with much smaller fronds and shorter rhizomes. Cytology: n = 36 ( Brownlie 1961 , as Cyclosorus gongylodes ). Notes: The names Polypodium unitum L. and Aspidium gongylodes Schkuhr, and combinations based on them used in earlier Flora treatments (notably Nephrodium unitum, Cyclosorus gongylodes , Dryopteris gongylodes and Thelypteris gongylodes ) are misidentifications of Cyclosorus interruptus (see Holttum 1977 ; Bostock 1998 ). A collection made by J.G. Klein from southern India (B-W 19770) was designated as the lectotype for Pteris interrupta by Fosberg & Sachet (1972) . This choice was challenged by Mazumdar (2016) who suggested that the specimen was collected after Willdenow’s publication of the name in 1794. Mazumdar instead designated a plate of P. interrupta in Willdenow’s protologue (t. 10, f. 1) as the lectotype. This interpretation was rejected by Fraser-Jenkins et al. (2017) who maintained that the date of collection was uncertain, and that the original choice should stand. Fig. 7 : Cyclosorus interruptus . Large population of mature plants growing in wetland.

Indusia tiny, glabrous or bearing short-stalked glands. Sporangia bearing short-stalked glands near the annulus, lacking hairs on the stalk. Spores monolete, minutely reticulate and with slight wings. Taxonomy: Allan (1961) included all indigenous New Zealand species of Thelypteridaceae within a broadly construed Thelypteris . However, Macrothelypteris is now widely recognised as a distinct genus of about 10 species in the Old World tropics and subtropics and the Pacific ( Holttum 1969 , 1971a ; Smith et al. 2006 ; Fawcett & Smith 2021 ). It is characterised by a short-creeping rhizome, rhizome scales which are narrow and thickened at their bases, often with marginal hairs, usually at 10least bipinnate laminae, veins in the pinnules which are branched and do not reach the margins, small sori with very small indusia, and sporangia that bear short-stalked glands near the annulus. Distribution: A genus of 10 species distributed in Madagascar, subtropical and tropical Asia and Malesia, Australia and the Pacific islands ( Fawcett & Smith 2021 ); two species in Australia ( Bostock 1998 ) and three in the Pacific ( Holttum 1977 ).

Macrothelypteris torresiana (Gaudich.),,235-1200mm-long; 2000mm,"Macrothelypteris torresiana has been recorded on Raoul Island from disturbed habitats and slip faces in open sunny areas, on banks, in swamps and on Macauley Island from the base of canyon walls growing with sparse Hypolepis dicksonioides . At North Cape, on Surville Cliffs, it was found on open ultramafic rock scree ( de Lange & Crowcroft 1997 ). Recognition: Macrothelypteris torresiana is recognised by its large fronds, glaucous stipes, 2- pinnate-pinnatifid or more divided laminae, free veins, indumentum of long multicellular acicular hairs on the abaxial surfaces and much shorter glands, absence of scales on the laminae, and tiny indusia. Cytology: 2n = 124 ( de Lange et al. 2004 ). Notes: Names used in earlier Floras based on Cheilanthes setigera Blume (notably Nephrodium setigerum and Dryopteris setigera ) are misidentifications. Macrothelypteris setigera is a Malesian species that has been much confused with M. torresiana (Holttum 1977 ). It was reported by de Lange & Crowcroft (1997) that occasional cultivated specimens of M. torresiana have set viable spores, and given rise to sporelings in the vicinity of the adult plants (e.g. the experimental glasshouses at the University of Auckland, AK 231884, 231951). This location is a long way south of the southernmost known wild population at Surville Cliffs. However, de Lange & Crowcroft noted that such occurrences are uncommon and that few sporelings survive, even in the mild Auckland winters. Further north, however, M. torresiana self-sows outside and can withstand winters in Kerikeri; iNaturalist observation #67228856 shows a plant that has grown in an old compost heap for several years. Source material was not from New Zealand and was grown in a commercial fern nursery. 12Fig. 16 : Macrothelypteris torresiana . Mature plant growing from a short-creeping rhizome.

Etymology: From pākau, a Māori name for this plant. Terrestrial ferns. Rhizomes erect or suberect, scaly. Rhizome scales ovate, thin, appressed, entire. Fronds monomorphic. Stipes scaly. Laminae 1-pinnate to 1-pinnate-pinnatisect, herbaceous, several pairs of proximal pinnae gradually or abruptly reduced in size; basal pinnae auricled acroscopically; aerophores absent; abaxial surface of laminae bearing a few ovate scales, short acicular hairs, and sometimes a few capitate hairs, or ± glabrous; sessile spherical glands absent. One or more basal veins from adjacent pinna lobes uniting below the sinus. Sori round, exindusiate; paraphyses absent. Sporangia lacking hairs. Spores monolete, with many wings. Taxonomy: Allan (1961) included all indigenous New Zealand species of Thelypteridaceae within a broadly construed Thelypteris . Holttum ( 1971a , 1973 ) re-circumscribed the genus Pneumatopteris , and included P. pennigera from New Zealand and south-east Australia in it, albeit as an atypical member with ovate scales on the abaxial surface of the costae when young, the abaxial surface of the lamina not pustular when dry, indusia lacking, and no glands or hairs on the sporangia ( Holttum 1977 ). However, Fawcett et al. (2021) showed that species attributed to Pneumatopteris occurred in multiple lineages, and that Holttum’s concept was highly polyphyletic. The New Zealand and Australian plant resolved on a long, isolated branch sister to the rest of the christelloid clade, and Fawcett & Smith (2021) described the new genus Pakau to accommodate this anomalous species. In 13New Zealand, the genus is distinguished from Macrothelypteris by its 1-pinnate-pinnatifid laminae and much shorter lamina hairs, from Christella and Cyclosorus by its lack of indusia, from Cyclosorus and Thelypteris by its erect rhizome, and from Pseudophegopteris by the basal pair of veins in adjacent pinna segments joining below the sinus, rather than being free. Distribution: A monotypic genus confined to New Zealand and south-eastern Australia ( Fawcett & Smith 2021 ). One non-endemic species in New Zealand. Biostatus: Indigenous (Non-endemic).

Pakau pennigera (G.Forst.),,340-2070mm-long; 200mm-long,"A terrestrial fern that occurs under kauri, podocarp, broadleaved and beech forest, under mānuka, kānuka and Salix spp., and in Carex secta swamps . It grows on the forest floor, in gullies, on banks, streamsides and alluvial terraces, usually in heavy shade and damp sites, but sometimes in more open areas. Recognition: Pakau pennigera is recognised by its erect rhizome, primary pinnae divided ⅓ to ⅔ to the midrib with rounded segments, greatly shortened basal pinnae, veins in adjacent segments joining, indumentum on the abaxial surfaces comprising ovate scales and acicular and capitate hairs but lacking glands, and sori lacking indusia. The network of dark veins on the thin green fronds distinguishes P. pennigera from other common forest ferns. Cytology: n = 72 ( Brownlie 1954 , as Cyclosorus pennigerus ). Notes: Kunze (1850) evidently believed that Cunningham’s ( 1837 ) concept of Aspidium pennigerum differed from that of Swartz (1801) and he created a nomen novum for it – Aspidium cunninghamii Kunze, Linnaea 23: 225 (1850). However, neither Kunze (1850) , nor Cunningham (1837) , provided a description and the name is therefore a nomen nudum. In any case, Kunze’s name is illegitimate, being a later homonym of Aspidium cunninghamii Colenso (1843) .

Sin. 8: 313 (1963) Type taxon: Pseudophegopteris pyrrhorhachis (Kunze) Ching Etymology: From the Greek pseudos (false), and Phegopteris a genus of ferns, a reference to the similarity of the two genera. Terrestrial ferns. Rhizomes erect to short- or long-creeping, scaly. Rhizome scales narrowly ovate, with short hairs on the surface. Fronds monomorphic. Stipes scaly and sometimes hairy (not NZ). Laminae deeply 1–2-pinnate-pinnatifid, herbaceous or coriaceous, the proximal pinnae somewhat reduced in size; aerophores absent; abaxial surface of laminae lacking scales, bearing unicellular acicular hairs, sometimes bearing short-stalked glands, lacking sessile spherical glands. Veins free, ending in clavate hydathodes, not reaching the margin. Sori oblong, exindusiate; paraphyses absent. Sporangia glabrous or with short acicular hairs. Spores monolete, reticulate or foveolate. Taxonomy: Holttum ( 1969 , 1971a ) recognised Pseudophegopteris as a distinct genus of Thelypteridaceae with about 20 species, mostly in the Old World tropics and subtropics. He considered it very close to Macrothelypteris in having ± bipinnate fronds with adnate pinnules, free veins, and a base chromosome number of 31. It differed in that the scales on the lamina axes were often reduced to a row of short cells with brown cross-walls, the hairs were never multicellular, and the sori always exindusiate. Holttum distinguished Pseudophegopteris from most other genera of Thelypteridaceae by the absence of grooves on the adaxial surface of the pinna midribs, and the presence of forking rather than simple veins, with tips not reaching the lamina margins or adjacent veins. Holttum’s concept remained unchanged following the classification of Fawcett & Smith (2021) . Distribution: A genus of 28 species distributed in the tropics and subtropics of the Old World, from St Helena, through Africa, Madagascar, the Mascarenes, Asia, Malesia, to Samoa and Hawai‘i ( Fawcett & Smith 2021 ); two species in the Pacific ( Holttum 1977 ). One introduced species in New Zealand. Biostatus: Exotic; casual.

Thelypteris confluens (Thunb.),,380-1150mm-long,"Confined to lake, swamp and marsh vegetation, or on peat in raised bogs; mostly found within dune slacks and their associated wetlands, sometimes found under mānuka, willows or pines, or rarely on old Carex mounds in open sunny sites; often associated with Typha orientalis , Machaerina juncea , Eleocharis acuta , Isachne globosa , Isolepis prolifera , Apodasmia similis , Cyclosorus interruptus and Blechnum minus . It is largely confined to coastal areas, but extends inland in wetlands on geothermally heated soils in the southern part of its range. Recognition: Thelypteris confluens is recognised by its long-creeping rhizomes, rigidly erect fronds, deeply 1-pinnate-pinnatifid to 1-pinnate-pinnatisect laminae, pinnae divided almost to the midribs, basal pair of pinnae not reduced in length, free veins, indumentum on the abaxial surfaces comprising broad scales, acicular hairs and short-stalked glands, and indusia bearing short-stalked glands.
